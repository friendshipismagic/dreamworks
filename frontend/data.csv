"My memory of this dream is vague. I think the setting is on a college campus. I'm in a cafe and two elderly ladies walk in and start talking to me about a university that a guy I am dating got into for law school. They were saying that I was accepted. I thought that this information was weird because I didn't even apply to this school. I got the feeling that while I was talking to these ladies, that they were interviewing me as art of the orientation to go there. I was also pregnant in the dream and he cafe that I was in was a hospital cafe. The guy I am dating is in the dream and we were talking, but I'm not sure about what.

"The scene of the dream was the same as the movie The Terminator. It featured my sister and mother and Arnold Schwartzenegger. We are in a neighborhood setting and I am outside playing on the street when a man drives up and asks me for directions and I tell him I am not familiar with the place he is asking about. He says, ""But you live around here and you should know."" The street he wanted happened to be the street we were on. Then the scene goes to a gym and I am confused about what is going on. Then I see Arnold and a big man with white hair talking at a table. Right before that I see a soap opera star on a nearby TV doing a commercial. My sister is with me and we are talking about the soap opera star. The actress's name is Lisa Rinna and she plays Billie Reed on Days of Our Lives. Then I see another soap star and this time it is an actress from General Hospital who plays Lois Quartermane. She is singing a Beatle's song, ""Yesterday."" Then I focused on Arnold and the man with white hair. They are in a grocery store that looks like a nightclub. The guy with white hair is referred to as the ""Boss"" man. He is telling Arnold to do something and Arnold doesn't want to do it. Then the ""Boss"" man starts to threaten Arnold, so Arnold gives in and does what the ""Boss"" man requests. Arnold commented on how much he liked Lois's singing and he got up and that's when I saw that one of Arnold's arms is robotic. It looked like he had just gotten into a fight and some of his flesh was peeled off and that's how I could see part of the robot arm. The ""Boss"" man got up after Arnold left and jumps for joy and starts to run out of the building. A pudgy little waiter or maybe the manager asks before he leaves is there anything more that he wanted. The ""Big"" man just laughs and says no. Then he runs out of the building. The floor started to shake and it seems like all of the people are going to fall through the floor, but they just vanish. This was a morbid thought for me because they just ceased to exist. The building then blew up, but it was then I saw that all the people have gotten out safely. I got the feeling that Arnold saved all the people that were in the restaurant.

"I was in a mansion or more like a castle and there was a person who was supposed to be the devil in the castle. He was snapping his fingers and slitting people's throats. I was running away and riding my bike through my neighborhood. Then I arrive at the preschool where I am doing a field study, and I am a teacher and my students and I are playing a name song. When it gets to one of the male volunteers, he leans in and kisses me. I don't recognize his face, but I seem to know him. I have a strong physical attraction to this person and throughout the dream I hope he feels the same way. Then I am with the children again and we are running from some other children who are the devil. The devil looks like someone from Bach's era. He has a wide grin on his malicious-looking face. The children and I are escaping in a jeep, but have to leave the jeep and continue on foot. We are in a jungle now and I lose one of the children, which has me scared, but then I found the child again, alive and well.

"This dream took place in the water. Two sisters wanted to be mermaids. So they turned into mermaids, but one of the sisters really wanted to have her sister's legs, so she took them. She returned them to their rightful owner after she was done using them. One of my sorority sisters whom I haven't seen in a while was also in my dream. She was telling me she was going to school in another state, and I told her that I had family there. I felt uncomfortable talking to her and I could sense tension between us. We had been taking care of some babies as we were talking and I felt like she didn't like me, or had something against me.

"The guy that I have been dating was standing in his room naked with one of his housemates who is a girl, and someone whom he has previously slept with. She was lying on the floor, also naked. I walked into the room and as I saw them, they both told me not to worry, that nothing was going on. I believed them and said, ""OK,"" and walked out of the room.

"I was Wonder Woman and I was throwing a lasso over people and making them tell the truth. In my dream I also saw an Asian girl who was pretending to be Wonder Woman, but I knew she was a fraud and everyone else around us knew she wasn't the real Wonder Woman. I threw a lasso over her so she would tell the truth. I wanted to help her.

"I dreamt I was in a dorm room and saying goodbye to someone I had been dating. He was going off to school. In the next scene the room was full of people and then suddenly empty again, except for a pile on the floor in the corner that consisted of a corkboard with old pictures of me on it. This room must have belonged to the guy I was seeing, because I thought it was unusual for him to have these pictures of me. He really liked these pictures, which made me feel like he was really going to miss me, which surprised me. He was trying to kiss me goodbye, but I hesitated because there was a carload of my friends looking at us, and they didn't approve of our relationship. He left and I went back into the room, and it was filled with things all of a sudden. Then my new roommate was there and a strange guy came out of the shower and took off his towel and I got a shocking eye-full. Then I went to my mom's house, where I found my dog; she is actually dead in reality.

"I was in a back yard and it was raining. The back yard was sectioned off into two parts and the children that attend the preschool that I volunteer at are there. They started running towards a pool and I was struck with fear when I saw what the children were doing. I thought that they would fall into the pool and drown and that it would be my fault. I was afraid for their safety. The children told me it was OK for them to get so close to the pool, but I knew that it wasn't.

"I was in a city that I didn't recognize and I am with a group of people. I think the group was professional psychologists, but a friend of mine was in the group and it seemed wrong for him to be there. Then the scene changed, and I was in a street and I saw a car that came out of nowhere. I heard screams and I saw a man on the ground in a pool of blood. I saw two people in the car and the one who was driving happened to be a good friend of mine. He was acting like he was drunk and didn't realize what he was doing. Then the scene switched and we watched a person bleeding in a kitchen. I put water onto a handkerchief to stop the blood. I remember arguing with a young girl who wanted to come and see the victim. We said no because we didn't think she could handle it. Then somehow the girl gets outside to see the accident scene and there is no more body. We then started to clean up the blood and a police car that has been wrecked comes out of nowhere to survey the scene. I try to get out of the path of the police car. The car stops and my friend gets out of the car, and the police officer comes running up and arrests him. I am standing there in disbelief.

"I dreamt that my father and his girlfriend broke up. The reason was that she needed some space and time to herself because her mother had just died. The part about her mother dying is true in reality. I also dreamt that my mother and stepfather had separated because it wasn't working out.

"I had a dream that I had a child and had to cancel a test because I had to take care of the baby. I was breast feeding the baby, because it is healthier to breast feed than to give formula from a bottle. The person that I had been seeing wanted to know what I thought I was doing. The question was in an accusatory manner, like I had no business breast feeding my own baby. Then I left the baby with my friends and left. When I came back, they were feeding the baby Tabasco sauce because they ran out of milk. This shocked me because I thought my friends were more responsible than that.

"A male friend of mind had finally come back from his vacation and I was flirting with him and he turned me down. We were eating pancakes outside.

"I was at my house in my home town and I saw the guy I had been dating. I was sitting down tying my shoelace and he turned to me and smiled. He came over and started to talk to me. Then I was inside a boat, trying on an old formal dress. There were other people with me helping me with the dress. One of them, a male, was looking me up and down. He wouldn't take his eyes off me. It felt good after being rejected.

"I was in a place that I didn't recognize, but the people who were with me were familiar to me. There was a big group standing around a picnic table. My father was talking and saying ""thank you"" to all the people who comforted me and helped me through the tough times that I was going through. Then a housemate of mine asked if my father had considered her one of the people who helped me. He told her that she only helped me out a little. Since she and I were having problems, I didn't think that was appropriate to say, and I took my dad aside and said that what he said to her didn't help the situation between us. When we went back to the table, I was sure that there was going to be a big confrontation. I was surprised when no confrontation occurred.

"I was pushing a baby carriage to a meeting at the preschool where I used to volunteer. In the carriage was a girl from the preschool that I used to spend a lot of time with. I felt extremely apprehensive and not sure if I would be welcomed back because I had been gone so long. I then saw the guy that I used to date playing with the kids. I was surprised he was there. Then the scene switched and my two housemates came into a room where a group of people was drinking. A party was going on and my housemates started to yell at some of the people because they were underage and drinking. I had yelled back at them because I was the only one drinking alcohol and I thought they were overreacting to the situation. I told them that they were being really hypocritical, and they just laughed. Then I was in a car with my closest friend at the university and we were going shopping. I just needed to get some groceries. She said, ""You get your detergent here."" I wanted to go to the grocery store closer to my house rather than the one we were at because it is cheaper. Then I said, ""Why don't I just go get the detergent at the other store?"" Then she said, ""Never mind, we will just go in here, it doesn't matter."" Then I had to go to the bathroom. The whole conversation took place in the store parking lot. Then my housemates came by and asked if they went too far when we had our argument before. I said in a calm voice that I thought they did and were being hypocritical. Then they said with a big smile that they were moving out in two weeks. This left me high and dry for a place to live, because I couldn't afford to live on my own. So I replied that I would make arrangements with our current landlords. They were just smiling the whole time like they were happy to stick it to me.

"I was looking at a mouse with a crowd of people around me. The people seemed familiar to me, but don't exist in real life. We were trying to figure out what to do with the mouse or where I should put it. I suggested my hamster cage. A woman in the group said, ""No, the mouse will never fit."" I argued, ""Yes it will,"" and I put the mouse in the cage. Then a problem occurred when I saw my hamster. I was afraid that the mouse and hamster would fight and my hamster would be killed. The hamster was in the first compartment of the cage and hadn't seen the mouse yet, but was moving to the part of the cage where the mouse was. I got the mouse out before anything happened to it.

"Throughout the dream I had a feeling of urgency. I felt that I was on a deadline to get an assignment done for school. I almost didn't turn the assignment in on time because when going to the campus, I took a wrong turn and ended up in the parking lot of where I went to high school. Then I was trying to get to a house that was supposed to be my house. This is a house that I had never seen before, but I knew it was mine. I'm at the top of the stairs in the house looking down them. Someone had just told me that all of the animals that lived in the house were fighting. The dog that belongs to my housemates was downstairs, but I wasn't sure she was the one who was causing the trouble. Also my two cats were down the stairs and my dog, who is dead, was also there. All the time I was wondering what one of my cats was doing there because I had to give her away, due to the fact that she and my other cat didn't get along. Also I was surprised to see my dog, because she was put to sleep when I was fourteen years old. I had heard these noises of animals fighting when I was outside of the house, so I ran up to see what was going on. I felt that I was in a frantic hurry because I couldn't get up the hill to the house fast enough. I ended up running through the campus to get to the house. When I finally reached the house, I heard a cat screech and I saw lights blinking on and off, like a haunted house. Then my dog ran out of the house, obviously very scared. I noticed she was limping and her leg was bleeding, like she had been bit. I said, ""She needs help, she's been bit."" I figured my housemate's dog had been the one to bite her. After I saw my dog, I ended up in the house somehow.

"I was in a big, open space and the sky was weird cloudy blue. The sky looked like something right out of a science fiction movie. I was in a gigantic pool of water, collecting donation money for a philanthropy I was working on. I was expecting a lot more money than I received, but I collected well over fifty dollars, which surprised me. Then I was on dry land and celebrity Tim Robbins and my closest friend at the university and some other woman were there. Tim Robbins was squatting because he was so tall. We were standing around in hopes they would give us some money.

"I felt that this dream was the same setting as the last dream, just a different scenario, and I woke up in between the two dreams. I was dealing with a confrontation between my housemates and myself. We were on an outside porch. Both of my housemates were standing on the porch, and I was on the driveway looking up at them. It was a Victorian style house. The female housemate was upset with me and I didn't understand what I did wrong. She felt I did something to deliberately hurt her. What I did was never clear. She was yelling at me and saying that I never cared about her and she never loved me. I responded by saying she was a hypocrite and a fake and I thought she was selfish and self-centered. Then I went walking towards the house and found a present on the front porch and opened it. It was the game Perfection. I left and came back again and the gift was wrapped up again, but then I noticed an antique wicker bassinet holding the game. Then I sat on the porch holding a baby, talking about what was happening between my housemate and me.

"I was walking down a path and on both sides of the path were sand dunes. I was walking with two people and it looked like we were trying to find a place to sit. I knew ahead of time that once we found a place to sit that I would leave the two people I was walking with. I was just dropping them off, I guess. As we walked down the path, I noticed a lot of people sunbathing on the sand dunes. I commented to the people I was walking with that as we went down the path, the bathing suits I saw the women wearing were getting weirder and weirder. I said, ""People are just using them for show and not to swim in."" During the walk I didn't recognize the people I was walking with, but when we reached our destination, I recognized the mom as TV star Roseanne Barr and I was also walking with a little girl. As soon as we found a pot to sit, I left.

"This second dream is a continuance of the first dream. After I left the beach, I was inside of a house that I didn't recognize with two ex-housemates of mine. One of them is male and the other a female, and they were dating at the time I was living with them. I was in a large room, a spacious main room, when a big buff biker man drove into the house in a car and made a big mess. I had a feeling that he was my boyfriend, but I had never seen him before. Then I saw the car being destroyed and the room along with it. I noticed a hubcap turn into a blade on a circular saw and go crashing into the left side of the wall. From where I was standing in the room I was facing the car and the destruction. Half of the blade was stuck inside of the wall and half was sticking out. Then I seemed to replay the dream again; it was the same as before, but went a little further, like a movie. The crash happened like before, but this time the blade went flying through the air. It barely missed hitting my friend, the girl who I used to live with. Then her boyfriend and the guy I used to live with said to me in a calm voice as he was cleaning up the mess the blade left in the wall, ""You have to have a talk with your boyfriend. It's not good for us to keep cleaning up after he crashes his car in our house."" I agreed with him and then turned around and the biker guy was there and went up to the guy I lived with and said he was sorry that he crashed into our house and wouldn't do it again. Then the biker guy helped fix the damage done to the wall. When the biker guy and my ex-male roommate were plastering up the wall, it started to have an unusual look to me. It looked like they were putting puzzle pieces back onto the wall.

"I was driving on a freeway with my boyfriend and then suddenly I was at home feeling tense because I was listening to the messages on my answering machine and there was one from my father, wondering where I was because I was supposed to meet him. It was Easter Sunday and I was supposed to go and visit my parents. I had other things to do and couldn't go, and I was upset because I didn't want to have to explain my actions to my father. So I ended up yelling at my father over the phone because he didn't understand my position. Then all of a sudden I was in an apartment with all the female cast of ""Mad About You."" I was watching Helen Hunt (Jamie) running around looking for something, and her sister-in-law on the show found a gun in a cabinet and all the women in the room turn on Helen Hunt (Jamie), telling her she was a bad mother for keeping a gun around her newborn baby. Then Helen went outside and stood in the front of her apartment building in the dark, when a man came up to her to see what she was doing.

"I was on a tour bus with a group of people. We were driving on a mountain road. It seemed that we were in Hawaii or the Caribbean. The bus was going fast and out of control. Then I looked around and saw that my group was no longer on the bus. It seemed they sneaked off. The bus hadn't slowed down, so I didn't notice the group was gone until I looked out the rear window and saw them on the side of the road while the bus sped on. There was a young girl on the bus who seemed equally confused. She was either Hawaiian or of Asian descent. I couldn't tell. Then the bus driver, a man, turned around and laughed maliciously, like he wasn't going to stop the bus or crash. Finally we came to a narrow cobblestone street, and I grabbed the girl by the hand and jumped off the bus. She did something afterward. I think she thanked me and started to eat something. I was confused as to where she got the food. Then I started to retrace the bus's route to find the rest of my group.

"It was my graduation day and I was at the ceremony. We (the graduates) were getting ready to get our diplomas. We got up from our seats and went to the back of an auditorium. We skipped to the rear door leading outside. We were lining up and I was supposed to go first. I didn't know it because I hadn't attended any of the graduation practices. I was surrounded by my friends who were also graduating, but they had graduated a year or two before me. So I was the first one to walk down the aisle. They gave me a piece of thick white rope that everyone carried a piece of to link the graduates together. My father was seated at the back of the auditorium so he could see me right as I walked in. When I started walking down the aisle, my father grabbed me by the arm. I was startled. Then he followed me up to the front of the auditorium saying that I had to come with him. I tried to tell him that I was in the middle of something and I couldn't. I hadn't even gotten my diploma yet. He got upset and started to lecture me about not listening to him, and said that he was trying to give me something and I should pay more attention to him. So I went up to the stage and got my diploma, went back to my seat, which was in the front row. I put down the end of my rope on my seat and went to see what he wanted. I was upset because I wasn't able to see my friends graduate. My dad gave me my graduation gift. He gave me a piece of paper that told me what my graduation gift was. All I read was Theta Chi Theta, Spring and the word Baseball. There was more, but it was just scribble and I couldn't make it out. The gift was a season pass to watch a baseball game. Then the paper turned into glass and the writing rubbed off. I saw my mom, sister and Aunt Ellen (she is deceased) on a hill by my dorms, and asked if they saw me graduate. They said they slept through it and thought they could catch me. I was angry with them. Then I went back into the auditorium and saw my friends sitting and crying about graduation and even some people I didn't know were crying with them. I told one woman not to cry about getting an education. Then I went back to an almost empty apartment and was waiting for people to show up for a party. There was a strange golden-coated dog in my kitchen. There wasn't much furniture in the house for people to sit on. I was feeling disappointed about how the day went.

"I was in a room with a long table in it. There were mirrors and paintings on the walls that I was facing. It was either a dining room or a banquet room in a restaurant. I was at a fancy party, but felt out of place. I felt I was trying to find shoes to match my dress. Then I walked into the parking lot and saw two characters from the TF show ""Wings."" The brothers Joe and Brian were having a fight. Joe was with a girl telling Brian that he had to move out because Joe didn't have enough privacy. Brian was hurt and said, ""Fine, I will just move back to Connecticut or New York."" Joe told Brian that he didn't have to move that far away, but Brian said it was too expensive to live in the West by himself. I was watching the scene as if I was Brian, watching my boyfriend leaving me for another woman. I was feeling extremely bad. Then I went to place like Costco and this child, a little girl, about one or two years old came running up to me and sat on my lap and gave me a hug and kiss. Then she went back to her mother and sat in the top part of a shopping cart full of merchandise. All of a sudden I was overwhelmingly happy. Then I spent some time looking around the warehouse. I saw a lot of half-priced Halloween merchandise that was on sale. Most of it was candy. I remember seeing glow-in-the-dark candy ghosts and the child wanted one. I didn't think it was a good idea because I didn't think her mother would approve. Then I went down an aisle that had expensive jewelry, furniture, lamps, and designer rugs, trying to be careful not to break anything. Then I was on a high school campus looking for a friend who said earlier in the dream that she wanted to be a cheerleader, which I thought was very odd. She always made fun of things like that. Anyway, I was looking for her and saw her with some other girls in cheerleader outfits with her hair in pigtails with pom-poms. She then gave me a schedule of games to go to and I left very confused as to what just happened. I felt something wasn't right about my friend wanting to be a cheerleader, but at the same time I wanted to support her. I still couldn't understand why my friend wanted to be a college cheerleader.

It looked like the hallway of the elementary school that I went to, which looked as if it had been remodeled My friend who attended that school with me was in my dream. She and her husband were on the other side of one of the clouded glass doors making blowfish faces at me. I thought that was out of character for my friend. Then I was getting my car fixed and another friend of mine from high school wanted to give me a deal on my car. Then I suddenly appeared in a bedroom with my sister in it. She was in bed trying to sleep, but couldn't because an alarm kept going off. She told me the alarm was going off because she was using sheets that didn't belong to her. Then I was outside on the campus and two women staff members came up to me and said it is good that I am in the new program because if I was in the old one, it would be twice as hard for me to graduate.

My boyfriend saw me and asked what I was doing there, and I said that I was here to meet his friend to play pool. My boyfriend told me to wait a minute and he would join us because he was just getting finished with work. I said OK, but I felt disappointed because I wanted to do something by myself. I was always waiting for him to be free to go out and at that moment I wanted him to wait for me.

My boyfriend and I were cuddling and laughing upstairs when we heard noises downstairs. Both of my boyfriend's ex-wives were staying with us as guests. Wife number one in the dream is really wife number two in real life and wife number two in the dream is someone I had never seen before. I went downstairs and saw his first (dream) wife. I was surprised that she spent the night in our house. She was folding up some blankets and wanted to talk to me and ask me a favor. I got the impression that she wanted to spend some time alone with me to get better acquainted. This surprised me because I have never met her and I know she doesn't like me. So I told her I would make time for her. Then I left her in the family room and went down the hall into another guestroom. I saw my boyfriend with his second (dream) wife. Her name was the same as his actual second wife. She also talked with the same regional accent, but had blonde hair like his first wife in the real world. When I walked into the room, she was drying off. I think she had just taken a shower. As she was drying her hair, she looked up and saw my boyfriend and draped the towel over her shoulders like a man would do and gave him a hug. I thought it was strange that she didn't have a top on and left the door open while drying her hair. I noticed as I watched this scene that she had pierced nipples and that bothered me more than watching her hug my boyfriend. I left the room and my boyfriend came after me, telling me there was no need to be jealous and then we started to laugh and giggle some more.

The note said that his family couldn't keep up with him and got lost while following him to the room. Boom was supposed to be my boyfriend's nickname in the dream. At the end of the dream my boyfriend and I were reunited with his family.

"I was at a theme park and I think it was supposed to be Disneyland. I remember being extremely excited to be there. I was with my sister and couldn't wait to go on the rides. My sister dragged me to what was a huge slide. I thought that it was boring for a ride at Disneyland. I asked, ""Why are we waiting in line to go on something so boring?"" All the time I was in line for the slide, I was looking at all the other more exciting rides we could have been going on.

"It was the beginning of a new quarter and I was taking a bus or shuttle to campus. I was pregnant and I knew that I was supposed to give birth after my first day of classes. It turned out that I gave birth on the bus to a baby girl. Knowing that I had to go to my classes, I took my baby to daycare only a few hours old. Then I went to my classes and by the end of the day, when I went to pick my baby up, she was crawling around the daycare room. The room looked like one in a house, not a school. I couldn't believe she was crawling because she was only four hours old. I went to pick her up to cuddle her, and she crawled away from me like we were playing a chase game. The daycare worker commented on how fast she is when she crawls. ""I could barely catch her,"" she said. When I was holding my baby in my arms, I felt so happy because I had been waiting so long to hold her. I wanted to name her Angelica, but couldn't name her because I had to wait for her father to come for us so he could name her too.

"I was in a cafe and a bartender friend of mine, one who works with my boyfriend, gave me a rose bud. He actually put it into what seemed to be a creamer picture. He told me not to worry and walked off. I was sitting at the table putting on green nail polish. I wasn't worried about taking up a table because the place was empty and I knew the owner. The tables had table cloths on them and candles. I looked down and saw glass cuttings covering the tablecloths, like the tables in a restaurant I used to work in. The owner of this restaurant used to be the manager of the cafeteria in my high school and I used to work for him.

"I was in a place that I didn't know. The oldest brother on the television show, ""A Party of Five,"" was pursuing me. His name is Charlie. He knew I was unhappy in my current relationship and wanted me to leave my boyfriend. I was hesitant because I still loved my boyfriend and I didn't want to leave him to start a new relationship with someone else. There was also a slimy-looking guy who was also pursuing me and I had no interest in him whatsoever. I didn't know how to tell him to back off, so he just kept pestering me. I was running in a race in which I came in second. I felt all right about my performance, but I also thought that I could do better. Right after a race I went into a room to be alone and then the slimy guy followed me into the room and cornered me. That's when Charlie came in and put his arms around me in a protecting way and told the other guy to get lost. Then my boyfriend came in and just when I was going to try to explain what was happening, I woke up, ending the dream with my boyfriend and I standing face to face.

"I was doing an experiment and I was trying to describe what I was doing on a paper. Then I was in a computer room with my sister and mother taking a class. The dream bounced around a lot. I was outside talking to friends; they were people I didn't know, but I had a sense they were my friends. I had lost my keys and was talking on the phone for a long time to one of my partners in my perception lab group. Then I went into a store with an old high school friend looking at sorority paraphernalia. I didn't see anything I liked, so I went to another store I knew of that carried sorority merchandise. When I walked in, I saw a lot of formal dresses and the store seemed empty; no one was in sight. Then all of a sudden I see the owner of the store run from a bathroom across the hall to another room naked. I looked away a little shocked. She poked her head around the door and said, ""I'll be right with you."" I went into another room to look through the shirts and T-shirts. I was folding up a sweatshirt and putting it back when the lady scolded me for folding the shirt the wrong way. So I felt the need to hurry and get what I wanted from the store to get out of there. Then I saw my best friend from high school buying something, which relaxed me.

"I was with a male friend flying a jet plane and landing it, because something was wrong with the plane. He wasn't supposed to be landing his plane. I felt that he wasn't supposed to be in my dream. Then I was with my boyfriend and we were walking around outside in a park, when we saw a mother with her two children holding pictures of my boyfriend playing soccer. The unusual thing about this scene was the pictures were in motion like a video picture. The baby was controlling the speed at which the video was going and my boyfriend was acting extremely goofy in the pictures with his soccer buddies. Then we went downtown and I was supposed to meet him at a bar. Then all of a sudden he came into the bar I was in with a girl with long blonde hair. She was allover him and he looked like he was enjoying it. Then I came over and he left her at once to be with me.

"I was at some sort of show where Elvis Presley was singing and also making drawings on poster paper. I wanted to get a picture for my boyfriend as a memento because he likes Elvis so much. The drawing that was at my table had gotten wet and I had to throw it away. So I went over to Elvis and asked him to draw something else so I could give it to my boyfriend. He tore off a piece of paper and wrote something on it. All I could read was, ""To my good Buddy."" ...Then he invited me to his apartment later. I was walking around an apartment complex to find out where he lived. I stopped and asked two men who were standing around talking which apartment was Elvis's? They told me the apartment number and I went up to the door and knocked.  My best friend from high school opened the door and I was a little surprised because she is married to someone else. She said she left her husband for Elvis. When I asked her why, she said, ""But this is Elvis Presley."" I could see her point. Then I was in another apartment where I was getting a Christmas gift from someone I was supposed to be working with. It was a film advancer. While he was showing me how to use it, he broke the film that was in it. Then he and I tried to fix the film so that it could be used. Then I was with one of my ex-housemates and one of our sorority sisters. We were talking about going shopping for groceries and we talked about how this guy that I work with is a real player. We were also talking about one of our other sorority sisters, but I'm not sure why. Then I was back in the apartment with the guy that I work with when Heather Locklear entered the room and he took my gift from me and gave it to her. She smiles wickedly and throws the gift back at him sort of wrapping it around his head. So then he tried to give me back the gift. I didn't care that he tried to give the gift away after giving it to me because I had no feelings for him whatsoever. I took the gift back because I happened to like it to begin with. Then I was in a lecture and a guy from my perception lab group comes in and sits down next to me. He doesn't look like he usually does. There is a really annoying older woman sitting in the front of the class who is taking up all of the professor's time. I comment to my group member about this lady's annoying behavior. Then she stops talking and looks over at me.

I was talking about my class schedule and one of my friends was saying that I didn't register correctly for a class that is worth two units. He suggested I go and check it out. I said, ""It is too late to do anything about it now. I will just have to wait until the beginning of the quarter to get it fixed because I have to go to a specific office for the people in the registrar's office to help me."" Then I was in a downtown bar, and someone I used to hang out with was there and his hair was wet. That's why he looked unfamiliar to me when I first looked at him. He was drunk and draping his arm over my shoulder, telling me he hadn't seen me in the longest time and I should come over to his apartment and hang out with him. The rest of the dream involves me trying to get to his house and having a bunch of obstacles preventing me from doing so. Finally I get to the house.

"I was driving into a store parking lot and parked my car into a handicapped space right next to a black truck. There were two people inside the truck. One of the people was a male and the other one was female. The girl seemed to be in her early adolescence. After I parked I got out of the car, and then turned around. I see the two people who were in the truck get out of the truck and open the passenger side door to my car and get into my car. The guy was behind the driver's seat and the girl was in the passenger seat, just as they were in the truck. Then I opened the driver's side front door and yanked the guy out of my seat. I was extremely angry that someone would invade my space. I then locked my door and the girl locked her door so the guy couldn't get back in, and I knew then that I could trust her. Then when we drove out of the parking lot, I could see the guy she was with chasing us and with him was another male chasing us. The newest male was the girl's boyfriend. So these two guys chased us throughout my dream. I felt they were going to rape us, but I wasn't scared because they didn't seem like much of a threat. Then the girl and I came to a bridge. I was looking at the lake below the bridge and I was thinking that I would rather jump off the bridge and risk the fall rather than being caught by these two guys. The fall made me think of the one Harrison Ford took from a storm drain in the movie, ""The Fugitive."" All of a sudden it started to rain and the bridge was filling with water and I was wading through it. I felt like I was going in slow motion and was worried that these guys could catch up to me more quickly. There were a lot of people surrounding me, sailing boats and relaxing. Then the first guy I encountered came up to me and grabbed me so I wouldn't jump off the bridge. He said not to worry, that he wouldn't hurt me. Someone had hired him to chase me so that I would have some adventure in my life.

"I was away from home at college and my dad called me and said that he and I were going skiing for the weekend and told me to be ready by the time he comes to pick me up. I didn't want to go because I was busy and didn't have the time, but I didn't want to say no to my dad. After the conversation I find that I am walking in a crowd. I think I am at a food court in an amusement park and I see a teacher. I don't know who this person is, but I know that he is a teacher. I point at him and said that I know he is a vampire. It is daylight out so it is odd that a vampire would be out in daylight. I am suddenly in the bathroom of a house and the vampire jumps out at me. So I put him into an x-ray machine and go into the other room and turn it on so that the vampire would die. I thought the radiation would kill him. So I went back into the bathroom to see if the vampire was dead, but then he came out of the shower and grabs me. He is about to bite my neck and make me a vampire when I notice that this vampire is my boyfriend. I told him not to make me a vampire until I've graduated from college. He said OK. Then my father called me and said I shouldn't go skiing because the snow was too slushy and I wouldn't have fun. So I went to the beach and then I saw the vampire again and I signaled to him that I knew who he was and what he was up to. Then my father shows up to my room (a dormitory room) with one day left in the weekend, saying we should go skiing because it just snowed and it would be fun even if it was for just a few hours.

"I was in a lecture for my perception class. The professor wasn't my real professor and I thought that was strange. The man who was teaching me in the dream was Japanese. A girl who was sitting next to me is actually in my sociology class. In the dream I have a project due and the rest of my group hasn't shown up. So I get up in front of the class and do the project by myself. I figure that I am done with the project, but the presentation that I just gave was like a trial run and doesn't count towards the final grade. Then the girl seated next to me stands up and gives her presentation. Her group didn't show up either. Then I was at home in my bathroom and I noticed that all of the things that are usually on the counter were in a cabinet underneath the sink. I thought that it was odd that the girl I was sitting next to cleaned the bathroom and I don't even live with her. Then I was back at school in a room that looked like a science museum, but was supposed to be a library .The girl that had given her presentation after mine had come up to me while I was working on my project and said, ""You didn't even pay attention when I was doing my presentation at the last class."" I said yes I had and told her that her presentation was on photosynthesis. I wasn't really paying attention; I just happened to know what her topic it was. It surprised me that I remembered it.

"I was walking around a town that seemed familiar to me, but I had never been there before. Then a woman came up to me and asked me to help her deliver her baby. Someone ran and got her parents. Her mother I recognized from the movie ""Titanic"" When she came into the room, she was acting silly and out of character. The mother was so relaxed, as if her daughter wasn't having a baby and it was no big deal. I felt a special connection with the baby and mother. When Kate gave birth, the scene changed to a gym full of men and Bill Cosby was one of them. I was trying to find the baby's father. Then the scene switched again and I was holding the baby and it turned out that I might be the mother. I was trying to find the father and in my dream it was the father who had given birth to the baby. The character who is the baby's father changed three times. First it was someone I used to date a couple of years ago, second it was a boy I knew from high school, and third it was John Lauraquette. The first two characters I saw as very irresponsible. When the character changed to John Lauraquette I was in the corner room of a restaurant. Some of my girl friends were there wondering how I could be the mother. I remember having sex with the father, but I never thought that a guy could be pregnant. The father was being cold to me and a girl with blonde hair came up to the father and was flirting with him. Then she came and introduced herself me and I told her my name. I said it kind of off-handedly because I was interested more in the baby. This girl got really angry at the way I answered her and started to pick a fight with me. She started swinging her arms at me. I defended myself but had no desire to fight her. I didn't want to start a scene in a public restaurant. Then she stopped fighting and sat near the baby. The father told the girl I was the baby's mother and even though we didn't like each other, I still had a right to be there. Then she kissed him on the cheek and then a more intimate one on the mouth, just to spite me. I didn't care that they were kissing. I just thought it was tacky, considering they were in a public restaurant.

Two other characters from General Hospital, Alan Quartermane and Monica Quartermane, were giving Carly this operation. These two people happen to hate Carly, so as I watched, I thought it was odd they were doing the operation. Carly asked if her baby was all right and the two doctors said yes, but gave each other side-glances, like they were lying to her. They were planning to kidnap the baby. Then two African-American males were walking around the hospital arguing because they were lost. Whenever I saw these two, they were always walking away from me. They seemed out of place characters, like they were from another TV show and weren't supposed to be on the set of General Hospital. They were overacting the whole time they were in my dream. Then I was in the reception area of a hospital and the receptionist was called away. Then I saw someone tip over a container filled with tarantulas.

I could see the spiders grow and trample over flies, only leaving lifeless corpses behind. They were sucking the blood right out of them. Then I saw a giant spider, more like a monster, taking a fly and eating it. After it was done, the spider had a human expression on its face. Then I was at the house of my best friend. This house was an unfamiliar house that I didn't recognize as being my friend's house. It was as big as a mansion with a half-circular stairway leading from the upstairs to the main entryway. There was a group with me in the house. I sensed that they were up to no good. All my friends were leaving and I begged them to stay and not leave me alone with these men. Then we were all outside and these men took us hostage and were playing torture games with us. These men were throwing a big red rubber ball into a field, and if we didn't catch it, we would get shot. They threw the ball at me and I missed. I went to retrieve it, but kept on running. The leader caught up to me and backed me up against the wall of a barn and said that if I kissed him I could live. So I kissed him because I didn't want to die, but I felt guilty because I didn't  tell him about my boyfriend. Then I was in a bedroom on a bed crying, and then the leader came in with an alien who seemed to have command over the leader. These terrorists weren't fully human. The leader came closer to me and wanted to have sex. Then I told him about my boyfriend and I couldn't go on with his wishes.

The baby started bleeding everywhere and it was really scary. I was trying to keep her alive with ice and by holding her upright, and my brother and Lauren were really scared. The baby was OK, so I went downstairs to the kitchen to hang out with Judith and my father before prom. I was really happy because Aaron was taking me. So then right before I was about to leave, I asked where my mother was so I could say goodbye to her. My brother looked at me very pityingly and said that our mother had died last night. I laughed because I thought he was joking but he was serious and I demanded why no one had told me. He said because there hadn't been a good time. I started crying so hard and was hugging Aaron really tightly. He kept saying, ""I'm really sorry, but if it came down to your mother or your sister, aren't you glad your sister's alive?"" I guess he was referring to the baby who was OK after all the bleeding. All I could think was, She's not my sister! It was horrible.

I somehow managed to shower and get ready, and even timed my arrival at the rink properly so that I was neither too early, nor too late. I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did. It was almost as if I knew my conscious self couldn't see him, so I wanted my unconscious side to compensate for the absence.

It was similar to the last dream I had about them, in that Aaron wanted me to be friends with Britta, and he didn't try to hide her or anything to spare my feelings. He just outright showed affection for her and everything. And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true.

"I had such a realistic dream last night. First it was my last day at my job, and for some reason I was having trouble figuring out my time card. I couldn't add the hours up properly or something. I guess I figured it out though. Then the blonde girl upstairs (the one who reminds me of Aaron's Britta) was crying because her boyfriend's mother had died. So then I walked home (my job was near my house I guess), and on the way I heard someone putting down women. I ran over and started shouting at them before I realized it was Jackson. I later learned that he was speaking at his mother's funeral, and that I had misunderstood what he had said. I found him later that night to apologize, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. And I kissed him back and we were hugging and grabbing at each other. I was trying to remember if we had been doing this same thing years ago and just continuing it now, or if this is the first time it had happened. I must have thought it was the first time, but in any event, things began to heat up really fast and I remembered we were supposed to be at a funeral, so we broke apart. And then we were sitting in a golf cart, and I felt so...in love. No one around me mattered. I kept fixing his tie or holding his hand. Gabby (random) saw us and either was jealous of me, or wanted to protect Aaron from getting hurt, because she really disapproved of Jackson and me. I wanted to come back later to continue hooking up with Jackson, but when I got home I realized that I had to go back to school right away. Everything was so real though.

"I woke up angry this morning because of my dream. It was a situation like in Blindness, where we all lost hearing instead of sight. It was total chaos. I somehow found my whole family in this huge city and was crying and kissing them and telling them how much I loved them. I got separated from them for a bit, but I guess I found friends and we all did homework together. Then we were lying down, and not surprisingly, Aaron was next to me. My father had told me earlier that he didn't like Aaron, and I told him that it didn't matter because Aaron and I were no longer dating. Lying there, however, Aaron and I were together again and we were touching and kissing until another girl came and lay down next to him. Then he forgot about me and went on touching her. I was really annoyed and left and woke up annoyed!

"Last night I first had a dream that I was kidnapped and being held hostage in the woods. Our cell phones wouldn't work, and the people who had kidnapped us had taken our kayaks and paddles. My next dream was that I was playing hockey with my women's club team, but something was wrong, like one of the girls wasn't allowed to play. Then I was in the dining hall and I think Michelle had died because I kept crying every time I tried to eat. Then I was on an Outing Club trip with Jessica, Kim, Sydney, and Abigail. Rem and Kat and left behind all our spandex, so we were really embarrassed that we had nothing appropriate to wear. Alec tried to help us find them, which didn't make it all any less embarrassing. But then I think in the end we all went snowshoeing.

I guess I was doing psych research or something with this boy and his mother, but there dreams were so real that they would wake up and have things fro the dream. I went into the boy's dream and he was remembering when his father was riding a horse and had really scared him (the little boy). I can't remember the mom's dream, but it was something more related to my life. It was scary for those dreams to be so real, even though they weren't mine. And I had to get out of their dreams first before I could get out of my own dream. I had to consciously wake myself up.

Yet I was somehow very close to the Alps and everywhere else in Europe. I had to snowboard throughout Europe (which was tricky enough since I can't snowboard) and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I don't know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up.

They weren't skating, but instead they ran around with large oversized crayons, whacking a ball around on the floor. Sam had brought me, but I didn't want to play. I just wanted to watch. Philip was there, but I can't remember why. At one point, Sam tried to get me a crayon so I could play, and I think Philip was jealous. The rink was the deepest shade of green I have ever seen (or imagined). And the ""ice"" was yellow. And the rink was a sort of dank and deserted place, but there were secret rooms and an elaborate system of staircases. But this shade of green just seemed too dark to be real, but I remember knowing that it was green.

Mario was getting really mad at anyone who was talking. Next, I was going to a sleepover with all my old roommates from last year and my brother. Sophia was as annoying as ever, but I was trying to get along with her and be diplomatic. Then I was living in an attic in South America, where they had slaves. I had to take a really long train ride to get down there, and I kept trying to send Anthony letters, asking him to rescue me, but I couldn't spell his address correctly. The woman at the post office kept getting mad at me. When I got there, there was a bullfight. And then someone bought me a pair of those footie pajamas.

We were driving to the city in this awful stick shift car, and Maria was trying to get us to bake her a cake since it was her birthday. I think we ended up not making it to the city, and instead I had RA training again. But it was summer this time. I was eating breakfast at Heinz, and it was very crowded because all the athletic teams were there. I could hear Mario's voice. All the new RAs had to do a dance as initiation, and I was laughing. I remember seeing Philip and Ainsley and Roberto and Mario. Also Enrique Iglesias was there. There were paintings all over this whole room, really beautiful paintings. I was talking to someone about art and hockey and Les Miserables. I remember being really hot because I was dressed in warm clothes and it was August, and I woke up sweating.

We were in some room with a ton of other people watching The Office. I kept trying to be funny and make comments during the show to get his attention, but he kept rolling his eyes at me and scoffing and being generally quite icy to me. So I left because I was sick of flirting with him and getting rejected. I was walking on the street. I was with 4 other guys from my program, not specific guys, but I just knew they were on my program. They were laughing and joking and then I told them about how that guy the other week had harassed me on the street and hit me. Then they all started harassing me and grabbing and hitting me too. I freaked out and told them to stop, but they continued slapping me, so I started crying and ran up the street and straight into Jayden's arms. He hugged me and asked what was wrong. I was crying and he kissed me so hard and told me it would be okay. I was confused as to why he was kissing me when he had been pretty rude earlier. He said he hadn't wanted to flirt with me in front of his girlfriend.

It was dark and warm all around me, even though I think I knew it should have been cold and snowy. Kit was sitting next to me, his arm around me, and his five o'clock shadow rubbing against my cheek as he nuzzled me. I felt my entire body tensing, gathering energy, pulsing and warm. I squeezed his knee with my right hand; I have a distinct memory of digging my nails into his thigh to release the pressure. The tension was building and I just waited for everything to snap. The dark began to dissolve around a tiny yellow light that brightened in front of me. The light grew and shrank, grew and shrank, grew and shrank until it overwhelmed the darkness, and I was twisting and squirming and grabbing his leg and having an orgasm.

"I had a dream that I was engaged or betrothed to marry Wyatt, without really knowing it. I think I woke up on my wedding day and had all these things to do. I think I had some recollection in my dream of having been proposed to. And at the time I was thinking, Well, I could do a lot worse. But I'm only 21. Do I really want to get married this early? Does he even love me? And we haven't even had sex yet. What if it's not good? Anyway, I said yes anyway. So that day I had to buy presents for My mother and my father, because that was some sort of new tradition. Wyatt and I were riding in a limousine to go to the store, and I just kept thinking, This is so unfair. He still gets another year of college, and I will have graduated and will have to pay his tuition. I can't do that! And what if he hooks up with other girls while he is at school and I am working? We got to the store and I bought finger puppets for my mother and father. When I got home, all my underwear was strung up on a line hanging outside the door. I wasn't embarrassed, since Wyatt was going to be my husband, but I also didn't understand why it was strung up there. My mother had told me she had made all the arrangements for the wedding, which I suppose made my decision easier, since I didn't have to think about anything. All I know is that my father spent $160,000.00 on the wedding, which I felt bad about, since I don't even really remember having ever gotten engaged or telling them about it. I kept thinking that I was only 21 and had so much more to do in life. At the same time, Wyatt was a good guy and I could certainly learn to love him. On the way to the beach where we were supposed to get married, it started snowing. So that upset me, since the wedding was supposed to be outside. All the flowers were dead when we got there. And I didn't have a wedding dress. I guess that was my only responsibility, but since I had no idea about this wedding, I didn't realize I had to get a dress. So I ran away, and just kept running, away from everyone at the beach. I ran into my father, who was on his way over and I started crying and said I was so sorry he had spent all that money, but that I couldn't get married. I woke up, panicked, and so happy that I wasn't married.

"Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I don't know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The ""dentist"" was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and shouldn't eat candy. This ""dentist"" turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I don't find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp. Then I woke up.

"My first dream was that I was on a show like America's Next Top Model with all my girlfriends. We had to do different tasks or photo shoots before one of us was eliminated. I remember being worried because everyone else had really elaborate outfits, and I was only wearing a black t-shirt. One of the judges in the audience came up to me and asked if I was in another ethnic group. I told her I was in my ethnic group, but she still wrote down another ethnic group on my info sheet. Then Abigail and I were taking a break from the photo shoots and we went to the library, where we ate dried mangoes and peanut M&Ms.; The next morning we all had to take showers, and I had 3 sponges, but no soap, so I wasn't able to. In my next dream I was skiing with my family somewhere, but I still needed a new winter coat. My mother and I were going to go shopping. I think it was Christmas or Thanksgiving or something, because this old woman was there and she was supposed to be my grandmother, but she wasn't. My father was making apple pie shaped into funny faces. My brother was making chocolate butter cream frosting. I had two pieces of this incredible cake (it tasted so good in my dream) before I felt like a pig and was so glad I had only eaten that in my dream and not in real life. My mother and I left for the mall. The car was parked in the backyard instead of in our driveway, but anyway. I tried on lots of different coats, but they only had sizes 29 and 32, which I don't even think are real sizes in women's coats. I ended up not finding anything and left. When I got home I had to baby sit some random family I've never met before. I brought 101 Dalmatians coloring books and two boxes of crayons, because I guess I knew there was a little girl who would want to color. When the parents came home, they were congratulating me on being accepted to medical school. The kid's uncle had three heads, and I tried not to stare. Then I woke up.

"Last night I had a series of weird dreams. First, Sydney and I were in our room and we were part of some game show with some of our friends and other random people I don't remember. Every time we got a question right, we took shots of vodka together. Mario was there too and kept warning us to be careful. Later, I was in Adam's with Sydney, Jillian, and Reese. We were trying to decide when we should go get sushi for dinner. I think it was after final exams, because I was running on a treadmill in Adam's, and didn't have a care in the world. Next, there was some sort of funeral or memorial. All the boys on the hockey team were wearing the same team tie, and had to recite a piece of a eulogy for this person who had died. I remember seeing Trevor and saying something about him to my father. He told me that Trevor wasn't his real last name; rather it was ""Sierra"" and he just went by Trevor because it sounded manlier. Although I was shocked, I think I knew this. I felt out of place that I did not have this blue silk team tie, or the equivalent, and I also wondered why I was at this memorial, since I didn't seem to know who had died. Next I was in a building in Manhattan somewhere. I had ordered pizza and the delivery guy was doing a dance outside my window. A-Wall was there too. We were hunting around in our garden (inside the apartment) looking for a plant that would in ten years grow to be my husband. Then I woke up.

We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I hadn't been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I wouldn't have that same problem.

"I had a really elaborate dream last night that took place sometime in late May/early June, right between final exams and senior week before graduation. I think I was commuting between my home state and my college state for that last week because I was both at home and at my college . I think first, we had some big party to kick off senior week, but we also had something early the next morning, so people were trying to get to sleep. I was in a huge bedroom with Lyla, some other girls I can't remember, Miley, and Adam. I think Susanna was there too (in the abstract, not physically there), but she and Adam had broken up, or something. In any event, Adam was sleeping next to me in this bed, and he was tickling me and flirting with me, and I was trying to be quiet since everyone else wanted to go to sleep. Javier was there too, and some boy who introduced himself to me as ""Lacrosse."" Next, I was at home, and maybe my brother was graduating from high school again or something, because I was baking him a cake. It was a long, rectangular sheet cake with blue icing. I ran out of icing, so I had to make more, but no matter how much butter, cream cheese, or powdered sugar I put in, it tasted disgusting and came out this terrible shade of maroon. Finally I gave up, and just colored (with a blue marker) the parts that didn't have icing. Also, I remember it being extremely dark outside, even though it was early in the day. Maybe there was some kind of solar eclipse? So then I had to get back to my college , and my father told me I could bike there; it would take 2 hours to get to one town, and then I would have to walk 30 miles to the college town. This was crazy to me, and I couldn't understand how I was supposed to do that. I guess I got up there though, because there I was again in a Lily Pulitzer dress, flouncing around. There was a beautiful abstract expressionist painting on the wall, with the initials W.K. I knew it was Kandinsky, even though it didn't really look like his work. I think maybe it was some new, undiscovered painting, but it was beautiful --I wish it existed in real life! All of a sudden I was back at home again, asleep in my bed. I was dreaming (in my dream) that the reason Adam had picked Susanna over me was because she had sex with him, and I wouldn't. I guess in my dream this had happened to me a different time with a different guy, so it was a huge revelation. I woke up (in my dream) and got out of bed. I started applying black eyeliner to my eyes (I wanted to make Adam realize he should have chosen me) before realizing I hadn't washed my face or anything. Then there was a knock on my door, and I said, ""Hold on!"" while I grabbed a light blue robe (which I do not own) out of my closet. I opened my door and my father was there saying that my brother really needed us (I can't remember why), so I should probably not go back to my college today. Although Adam and my college and graduation had been on my mind only 20 seconds ago, I nodded fervently and said that yes of course I would stay at home if my brother needed me. My father said it was 10:30, so we should get going (to where, I don't know). Then I woke up in real life, and it was only 9:30, and my father had already left for work.

"I had the worst dream last night. It started out that I was at a party somewhere in some basement, at my college, but at a place that definitely doesn't actually exist. It was a huge labyrinth and very dingy and dimly lit. At the beginning, the party was fun. People were playing Beirut and there was music. I think it might have been a costume party because I think I was wearing a bumblebee or some other bug costume. Erick was there looking for me. I couldn't find him, but everyone else I saw told me he was looking for me. I saw notes written by him looking for me, notes like, ""Bea, meet me upstairs."" Anyway, the dream turned into a nightmare very quickly. All of a sudden we were running away from the building. It was daylight outside. People were screaming and running in every direction to avoid these gigantic machine monsters that were shooting people down like in District 9. Nora and I were trying to hide underneath a white plastic tarp. I was breathing so quickly and was so scared. I heard the machine's voice saying, ""I can see your blue shoe underneath that white tarp. Come out now."" I wondered if just maybe Nora was wearing blue shoes too, but she wasn't, and I knew the monster was calling for me. I waited until I thought maybe he had gone and then ran out to find my next hiding spot. I hid behind a wooden shed, but the second I peered around to see where the monster was, it shot me in the arm. It was really painful! I thought for sure I was going to die. All of a sudden I was lying on a gurney and being rushed back into the basement, which was no longer the site of a party, but a makeshift hospital. I couldn't move or speak, but I could hear the ""doctors"" around me saying I had almost no time to live, and discussing how they should take my organs now while they were still fresh. I was horrified and tried to speak to tell them that I was going to be fine, but they started draining blood and taking my organs. I don't remember the gory details, but I woke up in the same position (in my dream) after they had supposedly taken all my body parts. When I came to, however, I felt fine, as if nothing had happened. Even my costume was still intact. I was so happy I leapt off the gurney and raced around following the notes Erick had left me until I ran straight into him. I was so happy, but he looked terrified. He said we had to get out of here immediately. He brought me to some beautiful library with dark paneled walls, gorgeous built in shelves, and thousands and thousands of books. There were beautiful leather chairs, brass desk lamps, and huge skylights for the roof. It was dark and snowy outside, but cozy and warm inside. My whole family was there watching some National Geographic program about Siberian tigers. I started chatting online with Erick and some other friends. What was weird was that Erick was able to talk to me, but it was as if my other friends were ignoring me. I told Erick this and he said, ""It's because you're dead."" I distinctly remember my heart dropping as I realized this. He said that the only reason I could see him too was because the same thing had happened to him after he had been shot, and since we were both dead, we were on ""the other side"" and could talk to each other, but people who were still alive couldn't hear us. I guess I thought my family had been too absorbed in the TV to say anything to me when I got home, so I tried to see if they would acknowledge me now. I tried talking to my mother and brother separately, and then yelling at the top of my lungs ""I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF"" to see if that would get their attention. But Erick seemed to be right; they just couldn't hear me. I started crying and ran upstairs, which was my room, even though we don't have a library like that in our house. I found my hairbrush, which I also knew to be some kind of sniper rifle, and ran into my room to shoot myself. If I died again, it means I was actually alive, but if nothing happened, then I must be dead. It was the most horrifying feeling and I kept trying to wake myself up. I literally said to myself ""Bea, wake up! Wake up! This can't be real!"" I looked into my full-length mirror and shot myself in the temple twice. I heard the gunshot and felt the excruciating pain, but got up right after I had shot myself. I started sobbing, since I was really dead. I ran back to the basement where all that stuff had happened, hoping to find someone who could bring me back to life. I was crying and screaming and trying to find anyone who would listen to me for just a minute. I hadn't said goodbye to anyone, and all I needed was a few days on ""the other side"" so I could talk to the living. It was so horrible, and every time I tried to wake myself up, I couldn't, so I just decided that I must have not been dreaming. And then I woke up, thank GOD!

"Last night my dreams were not my own. I was confused and utterly clueless throughout the whole series. First I was in Mexico at the beach and stuck on some sort of movie set. Some blond girl was running around for a scene, so all the exits were closed off so people wouldn't come in. For some reason, I was trapped on the wrong side of this barrier, and all I wanted to do was go back to the beach. It was so warm and sunny that I was almost shocked when I woke up that I wasn't in Mexico. All of a sudden I was transported to some humungous house in the south of France with Abigail. There was a family there, but it wasn't my family and it wasn't Abigail's. Someone had some kind of disorder, and the family was making a video to send to a committee to get better hospital care for their kid. I was thrown into the middle of it, wearing some sort of costume, and having utterly no idea why I was there. Then Abigail and I were made to go shopping. We found a Wal-Mart (in the south of France). While we were shopping, Abigail started stealing other people's groceries that they had already paid for. The manager of the store caught us, but Abigail managed to get away. She caught me and started interrogating me. I began to cry until she said, ""I know it was your friend, not you, so I'll let you go if you find her and turn her in."" I didn't know what to do and only prayed that Abigail had run far enough away that I wouldn't find her and have to turn her in. Then I was in a classroom somewhere with Edwin and we were laughing and joking about something. Then I was at a ball somewhere wearing a long silver dress and Philip was trying to call me. I didn't want to talk to him so I snapped my phone in two. Then I realized I wasn't wearing a bra and became really self-conscious. Finally, there was some dog who was trying to follow me around, and I realized it was someone named Doug, a person I have never actually met in real life, but whom I knew in my dream to be my soul mate, who had the ability to transform into a dog. It was so strange and I honestly felt like I was just walking through a world of other people's dreams!

"I had a dream last night that I was back in my high school dining hall and Tony was there. My brother was there too and he was trying to get my attention, but I didn't realize. I was wearing a black dress and I think I had an exam or somewhere important to be. I also had to finish a book before wherever I was next going.

"I had a dream that I had accidentally booked spring break in Russia, instead of Mexico. When I got there, my father and I had to buy down vests, and all I wanted was for it to be warm. We were on a train to go shopping, but then I was on some pier in Brooklyn. Roberto was there and we were holding hands and walking down the pier. I jumped into the water, but it turns out it was actually this motor oil that could kill me. I was spluttering and swallowing the oil and trying to swim to the dock. I ended up spitting in real life, trying to get the oil out of my mouth in my dream. Then I was running on a staircase that was like the Guggenheim, except it was 14 stories. I tried to climb up the stairs, but the building was jello-like and really difficult to stand up. Anthony was there and he was so cute, and I felt like I was 14 all over again.

"I can't remember the exact order of my dreams. I think first I was going back to the city in Spain, where I studied abroad. We landed and immediately went to the Reina Sofia. There was a Willem de Kooning and Goncharova exhibit, except instead of their paintings, they were frescoes that were attached to the wall. And despite this, the paint still stuck out in thick brushstrokes. It was beautiful. The frescoes were oddly shaped, sort of like Frank Stella pieces, and they were all over the walls and ceiling. There were Picasso sketches that I am making up in my head right now, sort of curved cubism in reds and pinks, drawings I'll only ever see in my head. Anyway, I am walking around the Reina Sofia and I bump into Kit, Philip, Miley, and some other guys. I think Abigail was with me originally, but I was surprised to see these guys in Madrid. All of a sudden the Reina Sofia turned into this terrible maze, and there was this psychotic 12-year-old boy with a gun who was chasing us all around. I was now with a group of girls (none of whom were identifiable), and we were all tearing through this maze, which was perched on a mountaintop, so it was very precarious. A lot of the girls were shot. I dove under a table and went limp and tried to pretend I was already dead. Similar to the other dream I had, someone called me out on faking death. I was terrified and sweating, and sand was sticking to my face. I was trying so hard to cry silently and wake myself up at the same time. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wake myself up. It was like I was literally stuck in this dream. Anyway, the kid who was killing everyone came up behind me and I cringed, waiting for him to shoot me, but then I leapt up and faced him. He looked scared, and I tried to calm him down and talk him out of killing everyone. He said he felt like a monster, and I tried to reassure him that he wasn't and that he was still young and just coming into himself. I somehow got out of that nightmare and found myself in the dining hall at my college waiting in the salad bar line. There was some guy behind me who graduated a few years ago, who I can't name, but I think I remember thinking he was cute. He was standing behind me and flirting with me as I made my salad, which was spinach, tomatoes, pesto, hard-boiled eggs, and chickpeas. When I walked to my table to sit down with my friends, I realized that it was graduation dinner, and I was horrified that I had somehow missed my last semester at my college. I tried in vain to ask someone what we were doing, or how it was May already, but everyone was drunk and crying, which wasn't helpful. Then I woke up.

"I had a dream that I was back at my high school and someone was painting a portrait of me, so I had to lie on this couch for a long time while I was being drawn. I could see a tiny scorpion walking around on the coffee table adjacent to me and became worried that it would walk up towards me! I was then somewhere with Alondra and was getting married to Channing Tatum. I was confused as to why we were getting married, when Alondra and Andre had been dating for 9 months and weren't even engaged yet. Alondra assured me that this was a good decision. I was wearing a veil and up at the altar. Alondra was behind me, pushing me along. Channing Tatum kissed me, which was fine, but I just didn't understand why I was getting married. Next, he and I were in some really nice boutique. I was picking out different lingerie slips and dresses. I didn't realize they were lingerie until I tried them on and they were completely transparent. I was horrified and ran home, where my dad was purchasing the portrait of me. It wasn't an oil portrait; rather it was some kind of moving lithograph print. My figure comprised of the Benday dots used by Lichtenstein, but I moved within the picture. It was actually one of the coolest things I have ""seen."" Anyway, then I woke up.

"I had a really scary dream that I was studying abroad in some small Italian town. I had a weird Italian cell phone that wouldn't make calls, only receive them. I went into my apartment one day and five strange men I had never seen before had broken in. I started feeling like I was choking on the air and couldn't breathe. I tried to grab a baseball bat nearby but it was stuck to the floor. I started freaking out and ran out of the apartment to some building where Michelle and Gus were. They assured me that everything was ok. I left to go do something but when I returned to their apartment, the five men were there too. I was really scared and found Andy, who drove me away. Then I woke up and fell back asleep and had a new dream. In this dream, I was walking through a giant shadowbox that had all these unknown Picasso figurines he had carved as a boy. I picked one up that was a little bird painted purple and yellow. It was so cute and sort of looked like a more cartoonish version of his neo-classical stuff. I was so amazed that I had never seen any of this before --what a disappointment to wake up and realize it's not real!

"I had the most vivid dream that I was in the bookstore buying a sketchbook for architecture. The paper was all different sizes and organized into pretty different colored binders.

Also, I weighed myself in my dream and had gained 8 lbs --weird.

"I had a dream last night that started out as the absolute worst nightmare I have ever had, but it was a nightmare within my dream, so that when I woke up from the nightmare, I was still in my dream. In my nightmare, I was a mule for carrying drugs across the border to Turkey, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Israel. There was this horrible, creepy, oily, and disgusting man in his 40s, who was my boss/drug lord/drug dealer. The drugs were some weird form of cocaine and ecstasy in this red and black pill that I hid under my breasts. In order to get across the border, my boss would pretend to be fondling me while he took the drugs out. I was crying the entire time, weeping, sobbing, and doing anything to get out of it. I ran into Kingston once when I was about to leave Kazakhstan to get more drugs. I made the most helpless, pleading face, and he got the point and saved me. He grabbed me and sprinted me across the border, where the guy couldn't bother me anymore. I was so relieved that I started crying and shaking and sweating, and I'm pretty sure that was happening in real life as I woke up from my nightmare into my dream. Next, I had a dream that I was studying Michelangelo's sketches for the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The original for The Creation of Adam was not the iconic image of Adam reaching out to God, but rather a sketchy cartoon of God holding Adam as if he were giving him the Heimlich maneuver. I was confused because I know the real version so well, but apparently this was a sketch that no one had ever seen before and was the real creation scene.

"I had such a vivid dream about graduation in May. First I think I was in the gym doing sit-ups and Keegan came in. I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing. I am waiting to hear the punch line to this piece she is doing, but I can feel myself waking up. I fight consciousness so hard until I hear the punch line, which was, ""The musical, Les Miserables."" It makes no sense to me now, but apparently it was hilarious and fitting in the dream.

I guess I had decided not to go to ""Circus Night,"" and instead Abigail and I packed up our rooms because we were leaving the next day. The next morning it was pitch black out, but it was definitely morning. Abigail and I waited outside for Lyla to pick us up. She was an hour late and when she showed up, she was wearing a sequined full body suit. She hadn't showered or changed, and this is the first time I can ever recall smelling in a dream. She smelled like beer and a late night out, but it was acute and I could smell it. Lyla explained to us that the reason she was so late was because she had been helping a freshman boy who had gotten lost somewhere.

His brother and sister were there, and I realized he also had another younger sister. The odd thing was that is family seemed a lot like mine --they were really close and played games together and it was very cute. Then I was in a car pulling out of the driveway, and I realized his house was in this steep, mountainous landscape that I have seen in other dreams as well. Then I had a really gross image of having a gigantic pimple on my cheek. I poked it and the white pus/goo just leaked out in a shiny, white, subcutaneous glob.

Anyway, when I got off the train, I guess I was in the right place. There was some sort of party or gathering. But anyway, Calvin was there and I was supposed to hook up with him. I wanted to too, but there was some sort of understanding between the two of us that we were going to hook up, even though we've never talked before. It was as if we were just going to act on the sexual tension and there didn't have to be any sort of explanation. He was shirtless, but had on his white baseball cap. He was holding a peach colored silk sheet and was waiting for me or something. I think I was sort of confused, but I got back on the train and then I woke up.

"I had a dream that I was in some Health class or other with Tony and other sophomores. We had to give presentations that day, and I guess I had thought I was presenting much later, because I realized I wasn't prepared. I had to present on Lolita and then relate how that had to do with sexual abuse and rape. I had written some sort of song and had condoms with me to give out to the rest of my class. When my professor called on me, I panicked, but ended up having to present anyway. I think the presentation ended up going pretty well. Tony, as he was leaving, asked me out on a date and suggested taking me out to dinner. Of course I accepted, but then remembered that I was dating Philip. The next day, leading up to the date with Tony, I asked my friends if I should just break up with Philip, rather than cheat on him. I wondered why I was with Philip again since it hadn't worked out the first time. Then I was on a golf course wearing pink shorts and pink ankle socks and little golf shoes. I had on a white tank top and a pink ribbon in my hair, and I was skipping near where Tony was playing golf, flouncing and flirting and showing off. Then I had to drive a golf cart with Martin and one of his friends home. I was baking almond cookies that were not yet done, but I had already taken out of the oven. Martin and his friend kept trying to take them off the cookie sheet, which made me really frustrated. Then my_father came home from wherever he was and we were planning to have dinner at 7:30.

"The first part of my dream that I remember took place in an old classroom where I might have had 3rd or 4th grade. Sue and I were there with my college baseball team. The coaches and athletic directors had chosen us as managers of the team, so we were there at their first meeting. The meeting started ordinarily enough; the coach gave some inspirational speech, but then the talk devolved to girls. I distinctly remember Keegan being there and looking absolutely perfect. I whispered something to Sue about him being the captain. Martin and Trenton were there too. All of a sudden, the power went out. Sue and I scrambled out of the room to the parking lot. First we stopped at a cafe outside the classroom and we ordered caramel macchiato. When I turned around, Keegan was there. I lamented that I couldn't remember where I had parked my car and asked him if he would please help me find it. He agreed; I purposely led him in the opposite direction of where I knew my car to be so that we could spend more time together. I must have looked cold because he took off his sport coat and draped it over my shoulders. We went on walking through this rainy forest until we found my car. We had been joking about cars and baseball and clothes, and the conversation seemed so real, the banter, the flirting...I'm amazed it was only a dream. Keegan opened my car door and threw some of his stuff in. I was sad when he started walking away, but then he looked back at me and said, ""You're not driving off yet, are you? Come walk with me some more!"" Delighted, I followed him down some ravine covered in ferns and we went on chatting and laughing. Next, I was part of some secret organization on campus that was trying to change the housing lottery system. We met in this secret cave off campus that no one could find unless he or she knew about it beforehand. There were about 30 of us and we had these secret files on CDs that we were trying to erase. Drake burst in the door and demanded that we hand over the CDs. I had them in my hand. Everyone yelled at me not to give them to him, but to just throw them in the fire. I looked hesitant, so someone grabbed them from me and threw them in the fire to destroy them. I immediately ran over and yanked them from the flames and gave them to Drake. He looked at me as if he were going to hit me and ran out. Everyone started yelling at me for giving them over. ""You don't understand!"" I yelled. ""You will forgive me, but Drake may not."" A few days must have gone by, and I was manicuring the lawn outside my house --literally manicuring it with a nail file. I was upset because Drake hadn't yet called me. I thought I should just give in and call him, but I didn't want to. Just then Mommy was mad at me, but I think Martin didn't know I had given away any secret information. He offered me some of his pasta and I took a bite. Later in my dream I was eating breakfast with Trenton at Pickering. Keegan came to join us and I was so happy!

I was in Wal Mart or something and then I realized that Sydney's birthday was coming up too. I wanted to do something for her so I bought a gluten-free cake too. Then I was at home and I think I had a test or something the next day. I was anxious about something. Drake came into my room and we were fooling around a bit. Then he left for a moment (to get water, maybe?) and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had in real life or in dreams. It was so powerful and still going when Drake came back. I insisted that we have sex that instant, but then my parents walked in and it was horrible! Drake was mortified, and I was furious. I think my parents just tried to ignore what was happening. Drake was so embarrassed that we would have to have dinner with them later.

"I had a dreams last night that first I was in some school in Alabama learning to parasail. My teacher was very handsome and I had a crush on him. When the time came to leave, I hoped he would volunteer to help me parasail back to my home state. He didn't, and I was left to figure out how to work the parasail by myself. It was only supposed to take me 4 hours to get home, and I had to get home that night since my interview in New York was the next day. I landed in Tennessee by accident and was trying to figure out how to get back in the air when I started a new dream. I was walking to Pickering from spinning class with Abigail. I saw Keegan on the way but I don't think he saw me. Then Abigail and I were standing outside Pickering talking to someone and Keegan turned back and we definitely made eye contact. He spread his arms as if he wanted me to hug him, but I was too far away. Then I went inside Pickering: Andy, Alvie, and Professor Simms were all there too. I think Alvie was taking the GMATs the next day. Andy and I were walking around and he spilled his food and I think I might have woken myself up laughing.

"I guess my first dream was that my family and I were back in Mexico. Keegan was there and I was subtly trying to get his attention. There was some sort of art auction happening, so I had my father sell this Dali painting that we had. I knew that Keegan lived on 43rd street in New York, so I tried to get my father to sell the painting to a gallery in midtown so that I would have an excuse to be around there. I think he did, but I can't remember. Then I was tanning on the edge a black infinity pool and Keegan was across the pool. I was trying to pretend I didn't know he was there, but it was pretty obvious that I did. I think I was then sitting next to him and I all of a sudden felt very chagrined, so I must have done something to embarrass myself. All of a sudden, there was some announcement throughout all Puerto Vallarta telling everyone to pack up his or her most prized possessions in a bag because a dangerous con man was coming through all the resorts and taking everyone's stuff. Only now all of a sudden, I didn't have to just zip up my suitcase, but rather we were at home and I had to pick only a few things that were that important to me. I think I threw in my iPhone and laptop, figuring that any burglar would only want those items rather than the more sentimental things. I think my father threw nothing in. When the burglar arrived, we all sat downstairs in the family room while he ransacked our house, picking out things he wanted to take. He took some of my mother's jewelry, my father's laptop, iPod, and wallet. I think at one point my father tried to say no and the burglar pulled out a gun and loaded it. He aimed it at my father and Martin and I both burst into tears, sobbing and screaming. I distinctly remember thinking ""I won't have a father in a few minutes."" I was crying so hard, but I never heard the gun shot. I realized that the burglar was just using it to instill fear in all of us. I offered to take him up to my room and let him go through all my CDs in order to distract him from my father. We went upstairs and the burglar demanded an Akon CD. I frantically rummaged through everything and never found the Akon CD. The burglar ran back downstairs and started lighting all our photo albums on fire. It was then that I realized that my laptop and iPhone were completely replaceable, but those photos were not. Then I was back in Art History 101 and hadn't studied for my final exam. I think I thought I had, but in reality I had never made flashcards or reviewed for the essays. I went into the exam and opened my blue book. The slides flashed on the screen, and I was only able to identify 4 of the 10. I reassured myself that I could make the points up on the essays, but then I realized I didn't know anything about the objects. To make matters worse, I was writing with a gigantic indelible marker, which was clumsy and awkward to hold. I could only fit a few letters in per page of my blue book. Finally, Professor Durkin came over and asked how I was doing. I told him truthfully that I was doing horrible and had not prepared for some reason and also that I had this horrible marker to write with. He helped me talk out some of the themes in ""Hanging Lantern,"" a performance piece that I completely made up in my head. I wrote out ""seeking to but failing to find one's own voice"" on my leg in pencil. I guess he had given me a pencil to replace the gigantic marker and rather than ruin another blue book, I decided to write my answers all over my skin. Then I woke up.

"I had the worst dream last night! So I think I was in some very random location but there was a bookstore on the hillside. Some anonymous friend and I decided to spend the night in the bookstore and read all night and just browse. So when the owner left and locked up, my friend and I just stayed. The bookstore must have been haunted or somehow possessed because that evening was really weird. First we were running through a labyrinth of human body parts. The walls were made of feet and toenails and animal claws, and everything was red and raw and smelly. There were plants made of human skin and body parts, but for some reason I just told my friend to ignore it and that it wasn't a big deal. It started raining at some point, and we took refuge at Bugler House. Some of the guys were there and wanted to party, but we didn't want to, so we went back out into the human body part maze. Then, and I don't know how this happened, but I was being raped somewhere. I think within the bookstore there was a mall or store of sorts and I was trying on clothes and some random man came in and forced me to give him head. I was crying and trying to fight him off, but he was a lot bigger than I was and was forcing himself into my mouth. I was sputtering and choking and trying to scream and it was horrible. As soon as I ran out of the dressing room after being raped in multiple ways, I ran into a street and a bus ran over me. Seriously. I felt the bus try to stop and I crumpled down as the wheels passed over me and the bumper scraped into my chest. I must have been lying on my stomach in real life because I definitely felt a physical pressure on my body and was finding it hard to breathe. I think everyone around me thought I was dead and was trying to figure out how to get rid of my body, but I knew I was still alive and was trying to yell out that I just needed to go to the hospital, but no one could hear me since I was completely winded. My friend and I found ourselves back in the bookstore and realized it was morning. We tried to leave before the owner found us, but as we were leaving, we saw police cars parked outside and knew we had been caught. The owner was striding slowly toward us carrying this long rifle. My friend and I were racing to get out and around the building and hide, but we were moving so slowly for some reason. Neither of us could just get going and it was painful to watch him approaching ever closer. He caught up with us and made us get on our knees as he held the rifle to the backs of our heads. We were crying and pleading with him not to shoot us. I had a distinct thought of ""I can't believe I have been raped, hit by a bus, and am going to be killed all in one day."" I was sobbing and thinking of my family. Then out of the middle of nowhere, this man and wife saved us. They knew the owner and told him they would take us into custody at their house. I was so relieved and grateful that I said I would do anything to earn my stay at their house and that I was just so elated to have been rescued. Well their house turned out to be a terrible orphanage. They told me my parents had died and wanted me taken care of, so I had to stay with them. They only ate steamed cabbage and pasta with no sauce and lived in the smallest, dirtiest apartment. They had some other orphans with them, plus my friend and me. Part of my keep was to clean the apartment, which was impossible because it was perpetually dirty, and I had to be the sex slave of the man. It could have been a few days later, or a month later, but I heard a knock at the door one morning. The ""father/master"" opened the door and it was my father! I was so happy I tried to yell out to him, but my owner said I had passed away. I was shouting and trying to draw attention to myself, and my father was so upset. I became so upset and started crying. I couldn't believe that my owner had lied to me about my parents dying, and that I could leave now forever and for some reason I was just physically stuck and couldn't make any noise. It was so horrible and I honestly thought it was the worst combination of things that could ever happen to me. I was so happy to wake up.

I feel reassured that I have a bunk and continue talking until the lights go out. Someone points out a bunk nearby and it is empty. I am relieved since I was quite anxious about having a place to sleep. I roll into bunk.

I note several women standing nearby watching me and looking at my feet. A bit beyond them I continue shopping very busily and wonder if it would be best to just continue on and all the way around the store to the exit or return and go past these same women. Later have gone up some stairs and first person I see is one of the same women. (All strangers)

"Am on a 'round the world trip and visiting Australia, where a busload of us have stopped to play baseball. I am last in line to bat and when my turn comes, I suddenly note the bus has gone. Looked for some familiar faces, but only found the stewardess. I was furious at being left behind. Later am in a hotel and same girl (a stranger) is there and I ask her when next plane is due since mine had left and could I continue the tour on next plane. Am dissatisfied with answer and I tell her I am so disgusted I want to go back home. The hotel is big, but seems very junky. I walk around the grounds to kill time and see a guy wearing a sleeveless tunic and a floppy hat. Later see some guy in a hotel room (different man, both strangers) and I ask him where I can get a tunic. He replies that it is made of sheep, like the one he is wearing, which is slightly different, but has long strands of hair. We walk into another room and then I am in my own room and see in mirror that I am wearing earrings. Am astonished and then realize the guy probably saw them but said nothing. Room is very disorderly and I decide to write a nasty letter about this to Pan Am. I go to an office of my company and ask everyone for some paper. No one has any. One offers me a tiny slip of paper. Every piece I pick up from a desk has something printed on one side. I am thoroughly disgusted and storm out to another building looking for the head office where am sure there will be paper for the letter. I find a paper store in the street and also realize at the same time that all I have with me is US money. The thought also strikes me that I was stupid not to have asked for paper at the hotel where there would surely be some.

Walk around outside the stadium and note everything, house, very honky tonk. I enter one and see a French movie star sleeping and awaken him. Then I ask someone to recall his name for me. I wonder why De Gaulle has not congratulated him. Walk to a table where De Gaulle is drinking a glass with some colored liquid. He mutters something about it being only a colored soft drink and that there should be more acceptable stuff around. He also mentions that the French Red Cross has labs there. He is at a large table with several people planning to enter a billiard game or something similar. Few minutes later he is gone and someone says he left in a huff. Later I see a man and a woman waiting nervously at an elevator. The man resembles De Gaulle but he could also be just a double. I hear someone say he is not De Gaulle, but that the General is out sitting on a bench with a girl.

Couple is familiar to me, but can't recall their names. The man asks for a ""gasket"" for breakfast and says it is a sort of melon. This puzzles me. I return to kitchen and look for plates and cups for water. Finally see kitchen has an immense variety of shelves of all sizes, containing all kinds of dinnerware in disarray. I determine place needs organization and cleaning up. I prepare a tray with some cups of water for the couple and take to them.

Finally get one and then I smash the net on the ground a few times to either kill or stun it. I stop and then see it is really a brown red fox and not a chicken. I empty the net and it falls on the ground, stunned. I grab a club and beat it unmercifully ... many blows. It seems to take much time and the fox appears to be looking at me and pleading for mercy. At one point its claw raises and seems to be staying my blow as it touches my arm. But eventually I beat it to death.

Later I enter a house and two Scottish girls that I apparently know well are sitting in the kitchen at a table with their mother. They appear to be visiting and this is my house. A fourth woman is also in the kitchen and apparently she is my mother. They are all laughing. I ask if they are telling unclean stories.

Say to myself: ""Why not, everyone knows I am supposed to be a man who wears women's clothes. So what!"" Later I appear to be wearing a skirt with same black shirt and hear someone say that it is afternoon tea time. A woman with a large oven opens the door and I see little cakes inside. She says to be careful, they are hot. I take a brown one that appears to be gingerbread, but I wonder what is inside. While taking it on a paper doily, I note some chocolate balls about 1"" in diameter on a nearby shelf and when the woman turns her back, I take some. Look for a table and all are full. But someone at a table invites me to sit down. I sit and feel good because I remembered to smooth my skirt properly. Later a woman from the institution, some sort of warder, takes 2 or 3 of us on a bus. I sit down alone at an aisle window, conscious of being dressed completely as a woman and with a neatly coiffed hairpiece. I look at arms in the sleeveless dress and observe they are too muscular looking. Some young boys enter the bus and apparently know the warder. They sit in back with her and are all laughing and joking. One is apparently sitting behind me and I feel a rake-like stick poke me under the rear and I jump with a slight protest. Then one of the young boys sits down alongside me. I see he carries a new, coiled bull whip. He turns to me and I note his shirt is open and I poke him away and off the seat with a small stick which I push against his chest. He leaves, saying, ""I'll get you later."" I hear someone else, one of the girls, jump in indignation and I guess someone has also poked her with the rake stick. Later we are in a bar. I see the warder and the boys and some other people sitting up to the bar. I walk past and sit down at an empty table in what I feel is ladylike fashion, smoothing my skirt. A boy approaches me with a mean look on his face and I begin to realize that the warder has set this whole thing up to allow myself and the other girls to fall into the hands of these bad boys ... and that the bus meeting was prearranged. I am afraid because I do not want to be touched by them or even worse, to be whipped and get hurt seriously. I get up and look for a toilet. Remember saying to someone that I had better use the men's room. Enter and note people staring at me. I enter an open booth, fumble thru dress, slip and corset and finally find my penis. I urinate standing over the bowl and immediately it fills up as my loud, strong and very yellow stream pours down. It flows onto the floor from a bidet which seems strangely connected to the toilet bowl. A janitor walks in and ignores me as he reaches up and pulls a chain. I walk out and adjust my dress.

I see a hotel nearby which is shaped exactly like a large can placed on its side. It's some three or four stories high. I am afraid it might slip any minute and actually roll on down the beach and into the water. It occurs to me that only those lying in the sand sun bathing would be safe, providing that their position coincides with the large rectangular openings of the can-shaped hotel as it rolled over the sand, crushing people.

After this I look out of window at other side of room, which gives a splendid view out over a very large city. In order to see directly down, I remove the screen, which is an old-fashioned type held on with two flanges at the top. The screen slips off the flanges and I hold it tightly and try to get it back on the hooks ... without falling out the window. Slowly and carefully I get it back on and then close and lock it. Later walk downstairs and in lobby of apartment house see some Chinese people and I feel friendly with them. I see a man who is the janitor and owner and with him is his Chinese wife. I offer to help him sweep a huge red tiled lobby area and I tell him that my wife also is Chinese. All three of us - janitor, his Chinese wife and I - sweep a section of the floor with straw brooms. It occurs to me that he really needs some large foxtail push brooms in order to do a more thorough job, and thus make less dust.

"Am in a business office where another chap and I are helping the former occupant to move out his stuff. Apparently I am to be the new occupant. One side of office contains many walnut shelves and drawers and we are looking thru them as the former occupant stands aside and observes. We check shelves to see if everything is packed. While reaching into deep lower shelves near floor, I find a stack of papers and without bringing them entirely out into open, I bend down and examine them. They appear to be personal letters on pink paper and while shuffling thru them, I see a $1 bill. I then slip out the stack and surreptitiously place them in the back of a drawer where I know no one will find them so that I can later examine them in detail when I am the sole occupant in office. I do this switch of location quickly and former occupant doesn't see anything. While checking other drawers, we find two long, slender and very shallow drawers near the bottom of the drawer section. At first they look like part of the structure and not drawers. But we manage to pull them out, the other man and I (not the former occupant) and we see they contain art supplies, ink and brushes, tubes of paint, all of which probably date back to some other former occupant of that office of some years ago. Apparently he had forgotten them.

Find old clothes and papers and at the same time a woman is looking thru the same carton. We speak in Spanish. I then note at the other side of room a meeting of men from my office. This is a meeting which I had declined to attend, saying I was much too busy. They look at me and wonder what I am doing there with the cartons. I walk past them, saying nothing, and look at my watch as though I was late for something. It says 10 pm, almost, and I reach for a phone to call home. Find the phone, but the receiver is at the end of a long wire and hidden behind some other cartons. I go into another office and it apparently belongs to a church. There are women and children in the room waiting for a minister. I don't phone, but walk out to car which I find parked off the street and on an asphalted lot. I swing into traffic just as light changes, cutting off other cars and manage to get to my lane and speed off.

Ahead of me are some soldiers marching and I put on the brakes, but slip toward them and actually bump slightly several men in the back rank. But they don't seem to mind and just turn and look at me slightly. Then I drive on and we all reach a cross street at the same time and must wait. For some reason I am squatting alongside the front rank and looking ahead and then I drop a handful of dust alongside a soldier and it gets into his eye. I quickly apologize and get in car and drive on.

It is yellow and has its door on driver's side all the way open and bent forward and tied down. This leaves the driver fully exposed. He is about 45, thin and disheveled and looks at me with a bored expression as he drives in front. The door, unfortunately, extends out in front of cab and thus is quite dangerous. This annoys me and I want to shout something at the driver. But I don't and I continue walking down the street.

A stamp collector I know, Gus, walks over and takes it from me. He pulls out stamps and they are all good items. He walks away with the envelope, saying it was his and he had lost it. Walking out double glass doors, I see on steps some UN stamps laid out on a black paper. All are used and sloppily mounted. I stop and pick up the only possible item of valuable content, a special UN souvenir sheet. It looks okay, but when I turn it over, it has tiny round perforations on back forming small stamp-like rectangles. All of which ruins its value.

I say Yes and he comes over and I tell him that I had heard about him from his mother who comes to the school each day to look at his empty desk where he used to be. We both agree this is absurd.

I am sort of sitting on very edge of bed and as I put my head back to raise glass and drink, I slip off bed to a standing position. Am aware that one is not permitted to leave bed or touch the floor and I pop quickly back on bed and start drinking again. But I slip again and still haven't tasted the medicine.

"I enter a bar with a baby who appears to be my granddaughter. A baby high chair with sawed off legs is on the bar surface and I place her in it. Somehow I have a feeling she is my daughter and I her mother. Someone brings dried kidneys and crumbles them in her soup (someone else had previously brought her the soup and she started eating it right away and I was pleased). I protest as this second stranger puts the kidneys in the soup, thinking that now she will not finish the soup ... but she continues to eat and again I feel relieved and pleased.

Note that trash baskets of neighbor on left are empty, but here and there across the street I note that a can or basket remains full while others are empty. I cannot tell whether garbage men have passed by yet or not and this is annoying. Then I see 3 or 4 full cans sitting on my driveway and remember that I promised the neighbor on the right that I would put them out during their absence. I think about putting them out even now, but am not sure whether it is too late or not.

Carl and I stop at a magazine stand and we look at some maps. Later am in my house talking with HH, a well-known stamp dealer, who notices a large calendar on my desk with the number ""024"" on it.

There are no direction signs and no numbers or anything on any doors or walls ... just the bright white paint. I wonder why Fire Exit not seen and realize this probably painted over also and this carelessness disturbs me. Now and then pass an alcove and there see a patient or two lying on mattresses on floor and talking to visitors. At end of a long corridor, I am confronted by three or four doors.

Walls covered with shelves, all containing dolls. She asks if I have a stand to hold the doll in an upright position. I say no and then leave. Following day am riding a large tri-cycle bike in front of house and pedaling along down a two-foot wide curb on a retaining wall that curves around the apartment house. As wall gets higher and driveway alongside deepens, I stop the bike and jump down from the wall and walk into the same basement corridor as the day before. Go to the doll room, but things have changed and now the door has a number on it like a suite of rooms or an apartment. Also the door alongside has a number. Room I thought was the doll room has a light shining under door. I decide to try the second room, and as I go to knock, the door flings open and the woman standing there seems to know what I want. She points to adjacent door and without saying a word, then closes her door and I remain in corridor still not sure I am in right place.

Then I take a small bottle of something, probably perfume, and fold my hand over it so it is hidden. Continue to look at other things on counter and then slowly saunter toward exit. In meantime have casually transferred bottle to my rear trouser pocket. Then an elderly woman in front of me drops her lipstick on floor and looks at it as I come by. I am not anxious to bend down and pick it up, thinking bottle in pocket may show. But I quickly stoop down in sort of feminine fashion, keeping back straight, retrieve it and give it to woman.

As we walk, some sections of sidewalk ahead seem covered with water, but as we get nearer they are always wet, but not covered. Then suddenly to the right I see a motor yacht heading into the sidewalk. We slow down and then the yacht turns parallel to the sidewalk and parks and I see a fat old man in an armchair on the stern. He looks German. On the door heading into a cabin, I see a German word, like ""Schwarzbuch."" The girl and I walk on to restaurant, but I am disappointed to see it is no longer there. As we pass under a tree, some water flicks on us as a young guy shakes a branch at us. I ignore him, but he does it twice more. Then I put packages down slowly and grab him and hold him on the ground by forcing his head into the dirt with one hand. With the other, I shake a branch and wet him thoroughly. I release him and the girl and I continue walking.

"There are four of us at the beginning and we are among Those on Earth. A spirit, a powerful angel, comes for us and we follow her through the air to a room -- is it in the clouds? The room is long and narrow, and we sit at chairs on the same side of a long, narrow table, looking blankly at the Earth somewhere below us. My chair is the left-most one, and I have a vague feeling of loss, a vague sense that the right-most seat of the four is empty. The angel announces, ""One of us did not make it, and we know what that means."" I do not completely understand the remark. Something about the angel reminds me of my mother. The angel then flies down to sing for Those on Earth. The scene is a rock concert, where the angel is on a stage with microphones. Her audience on Earth is very large, and we can see all of this from our seats in the long, narrow room. It is night time and the angel sings of the stars. I look at the sky and the stars appear beautifully to me. I want to see the stars more closely, so I get up and leave the long, narrow room, a move I am not sure I should be making. Curiosity is stronger than doubt and I do go back to the Earth. When I arrive I find I am a butterfly skipping across a large meadow near a mountain. One of Those on Earth sees me and touches me. It is very painful: my body, my wings, all feel as if on fire! Even the very sky turns red as I am touched, and I yell out a very loud, ""Ow!"" The person touching me can not hear the yell, and touches me again, apparently trying to catch me as I fly away in hurt. The second touch is just as painful. Altogether I am touched two or three times before escaping. Now I am hiding in the mountains, halfway between Earth and the long, narrow room in the sky. I can not go back to either, and I am now alone. And suddenly I have a great insight: the other from my original group on Earth (the one who did not make it to the right-most seat at the long, narrow table) is a butterfly just like me! The butterflies are the ones who leave boredom looking for beauty. The long, narrow room is a place we must go to when its time has come, but it is also a place we leave when we are ready.

""I guess carrots are okay"", I joke sarcastically, ""just no onions."" Someone ahead in the line calls down, ""No salad."" ""No salad?"", I respond. ""What about vegetable oil?""

There is an expert (paleontologist) standing next to me in the museum who replies, ""You can see yourself where the bones come from."" Upon hearing these words, I run out from the city into an endless desert plain of red-brown sandy soil blown about by a constant wind. Soon I come upon a quarry which is rectangular in shape and perhaps six feet deep. I walk down some steps dug into the ground and look around in the pit. There is a vague awareness of other people in the quarry also looking around. I quickly find some bones lying on the ground, and in the excitement of this discovery, I go running back to the city. I reach a modest ridge just on the outskirts, and get my first clear look at the highly varied architecture of the city, which appears to have grown in my absence. There are buildings in the styles of many ages, and as I leap off the ridge and joyfully bounce from the top of one building to the next, I imagine that I am jumping from century to century.

""Which play?"", someone asks. ""I don't know"", I answer, ""but I have his collected works."" Next to the table where we are all seated is my bookcase, and I pull down the red-covered volume entitled, ""Shakespeare's Collected Works"", and begin leafing through the index of quotations. I find a reference to one of the historical plays (which one?) and open to that page. As we read aloud from there, one of the women in the group suggests, ""We should try it in a real theater."" Somehow we indeed next find ourselves in a real theater with a live audience. All the members of the original group now have copies of the red-covered ""Collected Works"" to use as scripts, and a few of us, including myself, walk out onto the stage in order to perform from the same page that was read in my home. I begin to read the part named ""King"" opposite one of my woman friends who reads the part of the ""Queen"". There is a hub-bub from the audience and we are not being heard well. Another man (a friend of mine?) is now also trying to read the part of the King. Sensing confusion, I ask him softly, ""Oh, do you want the part? That's fine."", and I relinquish my role. Seeing that the lines are still being barely heard by the audience, I instruct both he and the Queen, ""In Shakespeare, you have to PROJECT."" The last word I speak loudly and clearly, and it rings throughout the theater. Murmurs of agreement in the audience follow, and then silence for the first time. I decide that since I no longer have an acting part in the play, I will be the director, and I slip behind a convenient shell on the floor at front center stage. The Queen reads her lines, and then I give a cue to a young girl, maybe eight years old, to read her part, that of a young princess or a magical fairy. Then the King recites some lines to the young girl. Both the audience and I are moved by the performance.

"A large group of friends -- maybe a dozen or so -- and I enter a pub or inn in a small cottage. The building is very old, and the pub is reminiscent of Medieval England.  We seat ourselves in a stuffy room at a long rectangular table made of a very sturdy wood and covered by a thin tablecloth. One end of the table is near a stained-glass window which shines colored light in an otherwise dimly lit environment. In the next room is a kitchen where much cooking is occuring. I have a vague notion of pizzas being prepared for our group as we sit around drinking beers from large mugs and making a lot of noise. Since it is a medieval- style establishment, there are certainly no modern inventions, such as television, around. Someone asks, ""Did you bring the TV? You have to bring your own here."" Another person produces a portable set and places it on a tall bench near the end of the table. The group goes crazy and starts chanting, ""Pella-vision! Pella-vision!

Among the fielders are two brothers, and I hear someone remark that it is nice to see them together again after a recent reconciliation. The older brother is in his mid-50's with just a few gray hairs, but is in very good physical shape and is quite strong. The younger brother appears to be about 40, has black hair and a moustache, and is easy-going in nature. The brothers are black. The older brother pitches, while the younger one plays the field somewhere near first or second base.

""He plays hardball"", I say, referring to the pitcher. ""He used to be in the majors"", someone informs me. A second fastball goes past me just as quickly as the first; I miss again, but this time my swing is a little better. This happens a few more times, each time my swing improving while still missing the ball. The older brother then brusquely announces, ""0 for 6, time for the next batter."" The younger brother takes offense at this and urges giving me another chance by saying, ""He's just getting the hang of it."" A brief argument ensues between the two over whether I should continue batting. Each is disgusted with his brother's position, and they turn their backs toward each other and will not speak. Someone says, ""This is just like their last argument, and they didn't speak to each other for a long time after that."" Attempting the role of peacemaker, I say to both brothers, ""C'mon.

"I am standing on a city sidewalk with X. (a female friend) and we are waiting to meet someone. An older woman dressed in a dark overcoat and a fedora hat approaches us; she is a spy or an agent of some kind who wishes to relay information. She says, ""Now I can tell you what I have learned. The secret is . . . "". At the very instant she is about to tell us the secret, a bullet appears out of nowhere and knocks her down, just like a scene out of a cheap detective story. I look out into the street and three taxicabs pull up ominously by the curb where we are standing. The three cabs are painted identically: yellow with a black-and- white checkered trim. Sitting inside are hoodlums or gangsters who are threatening us. ""I guess we have to go with them"", I say to X. The two of us get into the middle cab and we are taken away. We drive past a corner where a policeman who doesn't seem to notice us is standing. ""Just my luck!"", I say, ""The police don't see you when you need them."" After going around the corner, the cab stops, lets me out, and drives off. I am standing in front of a two-story brownstone apartment building. ""This is my house!"", I say, thinking that I have outwitted my kidnappers. I climb some stairs to the upstairs apartment and enter. The neighbors in the buildings on both sides see me and call out greetings.

"This dream takes place in a park very reminiscent of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. I am scheduled to give a public lecture outdoors, and an older person, the organizer of the lecture series, tells me to get dressed for the event. I walk off to a secluded part of the park near a fountain and proceed to undress. I am quite embarrassed by this, and hope that nobody sees me. (No one does.) When I remove my underwear, it becomes hopelessly tangled with the new pair of underwear, like two links in a chain. Struggling, I manage to put on the new pair as the old pair hangs at my side. I finish dressing and tuck the old underwear under my shirt, hoping nobody will notice it. I walk over to an area of benches where people are waiting for the lecture to begin. I see X. (a female friend) sitting there and walk up to her. ""This is going to be a good lecture"", I promise her.

He points to some handwriting at the top of the card which is in Spanish. I read aloud again, this time translating the Spanish into English for him. (I do not recall what anything on the card actually said, but I do recall that the Spanish section was about one or two sentences of simple words that I could easily recognize.)

I look for a place to sit, but the occupied tables are all full. Before sitting down I realize, ""The bank is in a hotel."" I go back to the cashier window, which is now an ornate desk in the hotel lobby, and see that my father has just gotten some money and is walking away with X.

Underneath me on the raft are various personal items including towels, shirts, cans of drinks, and a portable radio. As I slowly move from where the river is narrow and thick with vegetation to a wide open stretch, I listen to the radio which is playing a sad Country & Western song about a heart-broken cowboy. The radio is buried in the pile of clothing and is apparently sinking lower and lower into the pile as the music becomes more and more muffled. Nonetheless, I hear the words of the song quite clearly: the song ends with the cowboy telling his former lover, ""Maybe tomorrow I'll love again, But I won't be at your door.""

After that there is a brief pause in the conversation during which I feel upset that our encounter has been merely a shallow exchange of pleasantries.  I decide to elevate the intellectual level of the conversation and find out more about the views and opinions of Woody Allen. ""What do you think about Ross Perot?"", I ask, referring to the undeclared Presidential candidate. Woody Allen's eyes widen with interest when the question is asked, as if he is finding more in me than expected. I await an answer, but I can not recall any more of the dream after this point.

"I am reading about a new type of professional soccer league in a color weekly news magazine. There is a description of the game and some of the new teams, including a team named the ""Cosmos"", which the magazine article says may follow in a ""tradition of dynasty by previous teams of the same name in earlier leagues."" I find myself at the opening game playing for the ""Cosmos"". The rules are a bit changed from regular soccer: a center square portion of the field is quite a bit raised in elevation over the rest (i.e., it is not a level playing field.) This center portion is landscaped with bushes and trees, and the rest of the field, which looks like a standard field, is reached by steep ramps. Play begins at the center of the square section. The ball makes its way towards the goal of the opponents of the ""Cosmos"". I am standing there, and when the ball is nearby I kick it to the goal. I watch almost as if in slow-motion as the opponents' goal-keeper misses. I have scored a goal and everyone in the crowd cheers! Play resumes. I see that several players use their hands in this version of soccer, but I am not sure when this is allowed, so I decide to play as if it were regular soccer. Again I am standing near the opposing goal as the ball comes. I break out of a pack of players to get to the ball and from the right wing position I kick it into the goal. The poor opposing goalkeeper looks overwhelmed as the score goes by him. In an apparently new rule, after the goal is scored the goalkeeper himself kicks out the ball into play (instead of starting at the center of the field.) The opposing team plays sloppily and I quickly get possession of the ball again. I boot it hard directly at the goal and score a third time. The crowd goes wild as I exclaim, ""I LOVE this game!"" I turn to my brother X., who is one of my ""Cosmos"" teammates, and confide to him, ""Their goalie is not too good; they should get another one.""

I am bored with my position and decide to explore. I follow the elevated sand walkway and reach the turret. The view is nice, but there are some large rocks ahead which block the vista of the sea. I leave the smoothly constructed sand castle and climb down onto the rough, jagged rocks. The going is slow but I eventually reach the top of a tall rock right at the water's edge. I look below and see Y. (a female friend from work) swimming in the ocean. ""Come on in"", she calls, ""it's nice.""

Just as I start walking towards another elevator, X. cries out, ""Here it is!"" The original elevator opens, and a large mob sweeps us in with them. When I get off the elevator, I find myself alone at Cairo Airport. In marked contrast to its Israeli counterpart, this airport is quiet, relaxed and almost empty. I find myself lying down outdoors on a patch of grass near a runway. The sun shines brightly and the airfield is surrounded by lush green trees. As I lazily look up from my siesta, I spot a small, single-passenger pedal-powered airplane hovering overhead. The pilot spins his craft, then stops it in mid-air, as he pedals what looks like a black flywheel with bicycle pedals attached. Then he releases the flywheel and glides away. The flywheel falls quickly and strikes a young man lying on the ground close to me. He does not appear to be hurt, but he is clearly annoyed. There is a young woman lying at his side who says of the pilot, ""What an idiot!"" Then the two of them look at each other and she hugs him around the waist. I get up and walk towards a nearby building. On the way a large group of teenagers passes in the opposite direction. At first I see a few boys and a few girls and do not note anything unusual. Then I see a boy walk by wearing a tank-top shirt which exposes his highly muscular arms. Soon another boy with a similar shirt walks by; he, too, has highly muscular arms. After him follows another boy with muscular arms, and then another and another. As the dream ends, there is a parade of youths with muscular arms walking past.

This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height.

She looks confused and opens a small piece of paper with the words ""Republic Airport"" written down, indicating that she is lost and seeks help. ""It is not far from here"", I say. Then she explains that her passenger is ""X.'s wife"", i.e., the wife of my girlfriend's boss. She asks if I can drive the two of them to the airport. I hesitate. Then the passenger gets out of the car and comes to the door. She is a tall, attractive middle-aged woman. ""Pleased to meet you, Doctor Y."", she says to me gracefully. Impressed that she knows my title, I think to myself, ""She really knows who I am."" Then I say to the two women, ""Okay, let's go.""

"I am at a scientific conference being held in a large auditorium. I am sitting somewhere in the middle section when it is my turn to speak. I go to the front of the room and show my slides. Afterwards I sit down again, this time on the right-hand side of the hall. Looking among my papers, I find a book containing copies of all of the slides from all of the talks, including my own. One of my graphs is reproduced in a shiny metallic ink. ""Oh, this is a good idea"", I say to myself about the book.

"There is a woman who is the wife of someone else appearing earlier in the dream. Just to do something wild, she throws plastics bags filled with English Muffins into the swimming pool water and then she goes underwater herself. Inside the water it is peaceful and very quiet and she enjoys just sitting there, isolated from the outside world. She stands up and stares at the surface of the water which has now become a vertical wall rather than a horizontal ceiling. ""It's nice here, but I can't live without oxygen"", she thinks to herself, and she pokes her head through the vertical wall to the outside world. Now it is suddenly quite noisy.

"I am driving my bicycle down a country road which is on the way to work, moving very fast as if the bicycle were an automobile instead.  I am not driving too carefully because I am tired, and I think to myself that I should really be going back home instead of to work. Suddenly a small deer -- a fawn -- walks out into the middle of the road as I race past. Then another small deer does the same, and this time I almost hit it. I keep going on and I next see a few more deer which are fully grown standing in the middle of the road. Finally a truly large, obese deer blocks much of the road and I stop. I walk my bicycle onto the sidewalk in order to catch my breath. There is a man standing nearby who admonishes, ""Don't ride your bicycle on the sidewalk!"" I walk my bike back onto the street, and as I mount it I answer him, ""Look, I'm NOT riding on the sidewalk.""

"I am travelling by train through England with some friends. In our car there is an official reception for the Queen of England who is travelling in the next car. My friends have brought chemicals with them and they start mixing them together. One of the male friends explains that they are making an explosive because he wants to blow up the Queen. I am disturbed by this, but another friend pleads with me to keep quiet. I remain silent since they are friends, but I feel that this is wrong. Finally, I can stand this moral outrage no more and I act decisively. I grab a glass bottle filled with a clear liquid and pour it out a sliding door on the train, thus thwarting the bombers' plans. A guard or policeman is standing there, and I complain to him, ""You need tighter security around your Queen. In my country, you'd never get so close to the President with the materials for a bomb.""

"I am watching the filming of a movie scene involving three or four fast-moving cars. The people in the cars are all young and crazy, and they are having a lot of fun doing outrageous things, such as sitting outside on the roof of the car as it speeds. One young lady leans out of a passenger-side window so far that only her feet are still in the car; her head is held up by a man standing on the hood of the car next to hers. Suddenly one of the cars bumps into a structure on the side of the road and catches fire. The car comes to a stop by a nearby building, causing the building to catch fire also. A big wall of fire jumps out and now several buildings in the vicinty are burning as well. I am standing outside and am now surrounded by the flames. I am not sure whether this is a tragic accident or a planned part of the movie.

Someone tells me that there is an orientation meeting for my group at 9 a.m., but I miss it. I arrive at the Capitol Building, and I can't find anything. I am standing in a large hallway made entirely of marble when I recognize other people in my program walking about, seeming to know where they are going. I ask several of them for directions, and they answer with the names of departments that I have never heard of. ""How was the meeting this morning?"", I ask another. ""Oh, it was funny"", he answers, ""They did a show. But you didn't miss anything important."" I am still lost, but I get a copy of a map that says ""Federal Triangle"" on the cover. Inside is the layout of many of federal office buildings with each individual office marked. ""Wow, this is a useful map!"", I think to myself. Then it is time to make plans for the evening. I say, ""Should I stay here or go home?"" X. (a friend of mine on Long Island, originally from England), who is standing next to me, says, ""Well, I went home from here, but you'll have to fly if you want to get back in time in the morning.""

"I am delivering a guest lecture for a colleague in a modern college auditorium which has a lot of high-technology audio- visual aids set up. The audience in the lecture hall is small, but a video camera broadcasts my face to a medium-sized television screen. I feel that I am not effectively making my point, which is about books written by a forgotten author. While still talking, I fumble around with cables, trying to connect the video signal to a larger screen. Finally it works and my image appears on a movie-sized screen hanging from the ceiling. I feel more confident now because this picture is much more impressive than before. I show one book by a favorite author -- I can't remember who -- , holding it up to the camera for all to see. In it is a bibliography, which I read aloud. As I read each new book's title, I hold up that book, and its front jacket appears on the huge screen above.  Every book is more obscure, and harder to find, than the previous one. These books are precious and meaningful to me, but I wonder whether I am getting through to the audience.

""Have you met the new English post-doc joining our collaboration?"", I ask them, adding that, ""Her name is Z."" Suddenly we are all outdoors and Z. appears. She races across a street in a car or some other vehicle. The vehicle crashes into the glass of a shop window and she falls out of the car and lies on the sidewalk. Seeing this, I run down the street to help her. ""I'm okay"", she reassures me when I reach her side. Not believing this entirely, I examine her head to find it covered with fine shrapnel of glass. I wipe some blood from her forehead with my handkerchief, but she doesn't seem to be too badly injured.

I go there and am handed a calico cat which is the color and size of my pet A. ""That's my cat"", I say, and I am a little surprised. I start the voyage home with her. Somehow this involves a stop at my office at work. X. (a male co-worker) comes in and sees the cat in a carry case on the office floor. ""Close the door"", I say. He does this and then asks, ""Does she roll around the floor [in the cage]?"" ""This isn't a hampster in a wheel"", I answer, expecting him to know better. Then I arrive at my home with the cat, only to find that A. is already there waiting for me. ""Oh, this is another cat"", I realize. I put the two cats together on the living room floor to play. They look very similar, and I think to myself, ""I guess I now have two cats."" The new cat, however, frightens A., and A. stays away. I pick up the new one and hold her in my arms. Suddenly I notice for the first time that despite her beautiful fur, her mouth is ugly and has big teeth, reminding me somehow of a racoon. ""I'll call you 'Coon'"", I decide. Now Coon walks around the living room while A. sleeps. A. begins to shake and twitch in her sleep, and I realize that she is having a disturbed dream -- a nightmare? -- about being bullied by the new cat. She wakes up with a start, looks around for Coon, and moves away from her.

"A competition is being held for the purpose of determining who can break or shatter glass into the most beautiful geometric pattern. One of the contestants, a young boy, walks up on the stage and prepares to break a plane of glass standing beside him. For dramatic effect, he plays a musical flourish on a harmonica. Somehow the harmonica, which is tied to a string hanging from the ceiling, slips out of his control. The harmonica swings like a pendulum and strikes the pane of glass, much to the boy's horror. But the outcome of this accident is lucky, for the pane breaks first into four perfect quarters, followed by each quarter breaking into three pieces of equal size. The audience gasps in awe at this presumably winning entry in the competition.

Of course, in real life we couldn't all be sitting on the porch, but in my dream they were. Suddenly I wasn't on the porch any more, but was talking to Mary B. over the phone. While I was talking to her, her little 4-year-old brother got on the line and said they had ice cream at his house and he'd like me to come over to his house and have some. (This is very common, not at all uncommon.) So I went over there. Next thing I knew Mary asked me to stay all night (which is another common occurrence). All of a sudden the third floor of her house was a huge, big attic, no partitions -- a huge ballroom attic. I didn't see it myself, but I knew it was up there. (Evidently I had seen one before in my history.) Up in this attic was living a professor from Case, a very fanatic type. I had never met him. He was living up in this attic with three daughters and his wife. One of his daughters was named Lucinda and the B's were terrified of him, but yet he lived up there. It seemed that I stayed over at B's for quite a few nights. Every morning this professor would tramp his kids down the stairs to the second floor and send them to three pianos which were lined up along the walls. Each morning he would run these children down there, and say they had to practice all day long and they would very obediently do it. For quite a few days Mary and I didn't pay any attention to him, but one morning he cornered us and said he was going to beat us up because of our morals. Mary and I ran screaming down the stairs to the first floor and hid behind the stairs. He came running after us and for about four days. He was searching for us all over town and all this time we stayed crouched behind the stairs -- didn't go out to eat or go to the bathroom or anything. Finally one day he saw a coat moving behind the stairs so he grabbed Mary by the ankle, pulled her out and took her upstairs with him. I wasn't going to let Mary suffer alone, so I came out and went upstairs after him because if she was going to suffer, I was going to suffer too. I went running all over the upstairs, opening the doors and yelling, ""Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary!"" Then suddenly from downstairs Mary called up to me and said, ""What's the matter, Sally? Wake up, you must have been dreaming,"" and in my dream I had been dreaming.

They wanted Linda and my friend Faye to go out and get them next summer. Linda said she was too tired to go; she had worked hard all summer and needed the rest. So Faye said she would go and asked me to go along to keep her company. I said sure I would. Faye told me that we were going to fly out and the trip would cost $1000.00 and we were going to live there a month. So I asked my parents if I could go and if I could have a thousand dollars, and they said sure, for me to have a trip to the Rocky Mountains it was worth it. Linda said she would go a little ways with us and then she would get off and come back. So we started out and we were in the plane and some fellow on the plane gave me a present. It was a compact with a combination of rouge, lipstick, powder and cold cream all in the compact. We were going up a great big mountain and it was raining, and we got to the top of this real high mountain and the pilot said he had a terrible feeling this was going to be his last flight. He had flown 35 years, but this was the end. And Faye said, ""Oh dear, I believe in hunches. We have got to get off this plane."" So we decided we would get off at the next landing and look for another plane. And I was going to call my mother and see if it would be all right with her, so I called her from the plane. And she said sure, she wouldn't care if I had to get on a plane that was going to Tokyo first and then coming back to the Rocky Mountains, just as long as I would be safe. So the plane landed on the side of the mountain and we three got off and we were walking through the rain looking for another plane.

Mr. F. was there and he said that ""Mr. R. accepted a big boost in salary to do that to you, so you couldn't like him and so the prestige of our Studio would not be ruined."" (These photographers were witnesses like.) And I was very hurt and it hurt me more than anything to think he would accept payment for such a thing, that he was that low. It wasn't only the idea that he would do such a thing, but that he would accept payment for it. I felt like crying, but I didn't. Instead I just turned around and stalked out.

"We were out riding in the car. I was in the back seat. Daddy was driving. Another couple was in the front seat with him, but I don't know who they were. Mother was in the back seat, sitting at my right. We were driving along and all of a sudden we stopped and there was a big woods next to us and it was on fire. Daddy and the other couple got out and started fighting the fire. All of a sudden, I got afraid that the car would catch on fire so I kept telling my mother, ""Come on, get out, get out, get out!"" She was very calm and very serene, like she always is. So I got out and I began to smell the smell of gas and I knew the car was beginning to catch on fire and I woke up. Q: Did you notice any other sensory effects about the fire besides that of smell? A: No. Q: Have you ever been in or to a fire? A: No, just bonfires. Q: Haven't you noticed how noisy a fire can be? A: Oh yes. Well, I didn't hear the fire in my dreams. I wasn't that close. Q: Then why did you fear that the car would catch fire? A: I don't know. Q: Did you notice that everybody got out of the car but your mother and when you woke up, she was still in the car? A: Well, but I told her to get out and she wouldn't; she just sat there, calm and serene. Q: Were you ""burned up"" at your mother that day? A: Well, the only thing I can think of at all is that she told me to be cautious and I don't like her telling me to be careful, and I did blow up about that. I told her what I thought and where to go. In this case I resented it because I was enjoying myself. At least you should enjoy yourself while you can. If I want to get my fingers burned, well, let me.

"I was over at this house and it looked like Mary B's house, only you and K. were living there. That is, you were the people there, yet it was their house. They have a real big house. I was sitting in the middle and you and K. were beside me. We were all in rocking chairs, but then you and K. faded and it was Mary and A. And I was over there, I think, for lunch and their grandmother came into the room and said, ""Here, I would like to give you this."" In my right hand I had a stylus and just before she gave me these things, it changed into a cigarette, and I had an ashtray in my hand too. I had to lay them down to receive these things. In my left hand she gave me the most gorgeous orchid I have ever seen. It was mounted on a great big, huge cellophane thing like a doily; it had a twisted stem and the top was all fluted, and placed in the center of this was this big orchid. In my right hand she gave me a thing like a floor lamp, only there was no base, but it had the pole, and underneath the shade instead of a lamp bulb, it was all flowers. I smelled both of these and I was very disappointed because they didn't smell (of course, orchids don't). And then I got ready to leave. I was going to some house on Melbourne. I started out by myself and I was going down the street carrying both of these, the orchid in my left hand and the thing in my right hand. The sidewalk was very rough. I didn't know quite where the house was, and I was kind of concerned about it. I came to Phillips and stopped to wait for the cars to stop. All of a sudden, Carol said, ""Oh, here you are. I have been waiting for you."" And I said, ""I was going to your house."" And she said, ""Well, good. I had to take some things to the laundry and I am going back now, so we will go together."" And I said, ""Well, good."" So we went back together.

"Howard, a 22-year-old friend, and I were in the living room. He was putting on his coat and we were discussing how poets, artists, and musicians capture more than anyone else the feeling of the age in which they live. My mother and father were in the bedroom and kept yelling to me that it was late and to go to bed because I ahd a cold and I should go to bed early. I was very angry with them. I told them that what time I went to bed was my business and I would go to bed when I felt like it.

"I was married, but I don't know the man I was married to. That is, it is nobody I know now. First I had a pair of twine. In the beginning of my dream I had eleven babies and this is how: first the twins, Michael Allen and Margaret Ann; and then within the year after, I had nine babies born all at once: 8 boys and a girl. Mary Alayne, Dennis, David, Mark, Terry, - that's all I can remember. Everybody -- all our neighbors and friends and relatives -- were all here trying to take care of those babies because they all looked alike. Every last one of them was identical, and we had the worst time because I would keep on saying (I was in bed), ""Have you fed Dennis?"" And everybody said they couldn't tell if they had fed Dennis and they didn't know whom they fed or whom they bathed because they all looked alike. So I kept saying, ""Well, start all over again."" And they would, but still never knew. Everybody was going nuts. You never saw so many people, I know I was a nervous wreck. Then they were going to take the babies up to bed and I said, ""Where are you going to put them?"" And Mother said that there was one bed that the twins could sleep in and there was another huge bed that all the 9 could sleep in. And I said, ""Are you sure it has sides in it so they won't fall out?"" And she said, ""Oh yes, they will be perfectly all right."" They were getting me ready because the photographers were coming to take my picture since I was the first one to have nine babies all at once.

It was a V-shaped ladder, you know, two ladders together and they meet at the top. There was some kind of a cart underneath it. There was a girl, someone I went to school with, and she was little too, only she was big. And the teacher was there and all the kids were playing. The girl asked me to play with her. She climbed up one side of the ladder, so I climbed up the other. If you moved the ladder (it was on wheels), the cart went through the ladder. All I remember is that I ended up sitting in the cart.

He shoots a white cat high in an acacia or eucalyptus tree and it falls to ground and hobbles to a green compound and through a rotting board goes inside. I follow and see that it was Gandhi's home when he was in South Africa (c. 1890-1913). I go thru like the cat, but the cat has become my girlfriend in Japan when I was in the army, 1946-1948. She is beautiful in a kimono and has a red spot on her forehead like an Indian woman. I reach out to touch her and she's a pony who runs in a spiral--or gyre--and is rainbow-radiant in sunlight like velvet. She--the pony--comes to rest at my feet.

I walk slowly and go past an empty throne and see golden glow at far end. It is magic-scientists who wear white jackets like TV MD's and they turn pennies into gold on lathes. I go back to a queen on the throne and she says to me, ""Rescue the royal crowns."" She hits a lever by her throne and a cube of water rises in air like green jello and below the quivering water in the air is a rectangle hole about 8' deep.

I pull & she is in my arms--young, about 16, pixie haircut, thin cotton dress--no underwear, small breasts (like Audrey Hepburn or Julie Harris). She kisses me and I am pleased. We eagerly kiss many times. We go down the hill or mountain to a house where she lives. I realize it is a whore house where she is held captive.

The switchmen cut off and went home with a drag out of the industries on the tracks sloping down into a valley below, around a curve and out of sight. A poet I teach with said the switchmen left no hand brakes on it, so he had put enough on them to hold them from rolling. He then disappeared. I wanted to jump through the cars and look at an industry on the other side. Just as I touched a flat car of lumber and poles, the drag started rolling slowly. I decided to wait for an easy handbrake to come by and crawl up on the car and turn it to stop them. But the cars had separated and only three passed me. The rest stayed. I watched them go. They went onto a siding just before the valley and hit a wire fence--like home plate in baseball. The strong wire stopped them like a mitt. The tank car turned into a steam engine as it fell on its side. They were like toys from where I stood. I wondered if I should go home or go to the office. I decided to go to the office and to act as if I knew nothing. On my way I saw others derailed the switchmen had left when they went home.

"I was at railroad museum surrounded with old engines, rails, cables, and small replicas of stations and roundhouses. In one corner was a well, with rope and bucket above, but with no wall or curbing around it. My first wife, Betsy, was yelling at me, mixed with silence and surly anger and great hostility. While her back was turned to me, I gave her a great shove and sent her 15 yards head first down into the well. I was quiet, pleased, and surrounded by a crystal silence for a few minutes with her absent from sight. Then I thought she may be dead and I accused of murder. So I went to the edge and looked over into the darkness. Near the big bucket floating on the surface I saw the outline of her body, clothed, and by looking under the shadow of the bucket, I saw her face, and it had a slight smile and I saw she was alive. I talked to her and said I would lift her up and she looked and said nothing, but looked pleasant. I then tried pulling on the rope, hoping she would catch hold of the bucket. But she did not try. I then told her I would lower a second rope which she could put under her arms, and I and others would pull her out. It was then morning (as if a whole night had gone by) and museum employees were returning. Also, it was like a machine shop and real roundhouse with men nearby with overalls and greasy hands. I was afraid they would look down the well and I would be under suspicion. I looked quietly for more rope and found some. When I went to the edge of the well, Emma was starting up a rope ladder (used on landing craft and helicopters) and she was beautiful, like Botticelli's Birth of Venus, completely naked, with full breasts and ample white-skinned stomach, and smiling, quietly and restrainedly, as in the Botticelli pictures--Venus and Primavera--with wet hair not too shiny and sleek. Near to the time of touching her hand as she ascended, the dream ended.

One day she looked at me, warmly. Next time she left and came in the shadow where I stood and kissed me on the mouth (she looked like a student of mine four years ago who is young and virginal, and has reputation of resisting all sexual advances) and walked--almost drifted--back into the white statue. The statue never left during this trip to kiss me. The shrine was high up on top of building with long and straight stairs up, all white stone or painted wood--brilliant white--even roof and rafters or open beams, gothic peaks and pedestal except where long lines of tourist's feet had worn paint off and exposed brown wood below. During the kiss, the tourists in the line did not see her, but she seemed nervous and seemed to say--or said--""Don't let them see us or they will kill both of us."" Next ""day,"" another sort of non-sexy kiss that ""took my breath away.""

He was curious as to how she conceived--through anus was some of speculation. He split it and out came baby. The area was hairless and smooth as any skin. Afterwards--a lapse of days?--the woman was sexy and asked me to rub the newly made pudenda, especially the clitoris that was revealed or discovered or uncovered for first time. Some joy of sharing that first experience, but not complete ecstasy since a lingering memory of operation in that area, though operation and birth not ugly or bloody.

It was like a labyrinth. I walked to the far side and found no fence or solid hedge; it was open to ordinary city-dwellers and farms. At this far side was an asylum for the insane. They were mostly very ugly with blank white and pink faces and Mongoloid features--like sharpness of eyes, nose, and cheekbones rubbed out with artgum, like a paperwad or chewed gum--featureless and stupid. But not all. At this far side, normal rich people and insane mingled together in the labyrinthine lawns between 8-foot hedges. I couldn't tell smart from stupid in all cases. But most intelligent and most healthy were obvious and most stupid were obvious. I felt I was among obviously handsome and intelligent ones.

After they left, I discovered I was only man with five women, wives of men who left on excursion. Emma was not present, I assumed, and I felt free, but a bit peculiar, hoping I wouldn't do anything silly or effeminate. One woman appealed to me; she was tall with black hair. At a later time, I was standing behind her as she sat on a chair. I think she was naked and the other women were sitting in front of her on the floor. I reached around and stroked her. Suddenly Emma was there among them, but she, like the rest, acted as immobile as students at a lecture. The bus returned and we got ready to go. As the women stood up, I discovered one was a man, a small man about 55, with brown and grey hair. He revealed that he was the new curator at the college. When he found out I had been here several years, he asked lots of questions--their budget, his budget, attendance. I was surprised he knew so little. His attitude about his job seemed to be the same as his attitude about me feeling his wife--just impassive resignation that to be cheated right in front of his face was routine.

"Last night I dreamed I was with my brother in Spain, a sort of semi-desert place. He introduced me to an old man who looked like Walter Brennan. He had come to Spain thirty years earlier and had translated a Spanish poet he loved and printed at his own expense 5000 copies. None sold. Since this poet praised cheese, he went into cheese-making business, making a golden-yellow cheese which he gave with each volume that a person bought. He sold about 1000. But that was many years ago and he was almost bankrupt. It seems that the taste for yellow cheese died. So he made a Swiss-colored cheese, a whitish-yellow. And the room we were in had stacks of books against one wall and stacks of cheese--covered with salt crystals--against another. My brother wanted to help the desperate old man so he had printed in Spain a sheet telling the story of the poems and cheese and an address for American distribution for one dollar each, but no cheese since US government would not let his cheese in. I was back in USA writing a check for $2.00 for two copies when the dream ended.

As I took it by the neck and opened the door, the cat turned and bit me on the finger and sunk all its claws into my hand. I put the cat on the floor and killed it with a ball-pen hammer. I looked down and there was blood on my rubber boots that I was tracking over the linoleum, which I quickly wiped up with paper towels, thinking of what lie I would tell the children if they walked in. I put cat in white wax paper sack and ground was frozen, so I found soft, dry dirt and I dug a ""cathole"" with my bare hands under the edge of a raised garage. The next day, that garage was torn down and a new one of cement blocks was in its place. On the wall 5 feet above ground was my briefcase and in it was the white sack with white cat inside. Children and I were out walking and looking at fall leaves, and as they looked at bright leaves, I dropped it in a post office box.

We were chasing a horse that was loose. We chased it into the back yard under a big pecan tree. People showed up, some I knew, others like gypsies in painted caravans and old cars. They started building a fence from scrap lumber--new and yellow-gold, but not matching. It grew like a Spanish fan or peacock tail. ""It is movable so the horse can get new grass within the fence each day."" The ground so lumpy like old furrows covered with new grass. Suddenly I was in a house sitting on the floor, and a young woman in white blouse and tight jeans sat beside me. I put my hands on her hips. She moved and another took her place. She had red hair and freckles and was about 20. I quietly admired her clothes, hair and skin. And she quietly lifted her sweatshirt-sweater and rubbed her lovely freckled breasts. She rubbed the nipple between her finger and thumb. In the dream I assumed it was modesty, covering the nipple. But it was also sexy stimulation--both opposites joined.

The last page of the book had the word ELLIPSE done by Pound. I studied it a moment and said, ""Like Blake,"" but he didn't respond very much--just nodded.

There seemed to be about six of them, white marble, life size or a bit larger, all complete from sword and shield to high helmet. About a dozen people like me walked among them. Suddenly, the statues got off their pedestals and walked about, ignoring us but sword-fighting with each other--half playful, half serious like fencers. Three of them went to the rear of a statue of General Grant--or some Civil War general, in real clothes. They rammed their swords in to emasculate him, he crumbled like a statue and fell like a man. I saw it from both sides, looking down the thin wall dividing a room, the general in an open alcove to be viewed from both sides. Then they started in my direction. I wondered why, since no mortals had been attacked. I looked down and I was naked white marble. I escaped their swords by rising to the ceiling--no wings, but Will--and I felt my shoulders nestling against it like a balloon. Then I descended also by merely wishing to. I was thrilled by this. In the dream I asked if I was dreaming. I knelt on the parquet floor and felt my knees on it. I felt the floor and went through several proofs that I wasn't dreaming. I wondered why people around me didn't notice and praise me. Suddenly, a call for all statues to go into an auditorium. I felt something dreadful to happen to them.

"Mike Kovacs handed me a fat mss: ""I was sustained for years in a Communist prison by one sentence from a Mark Harris novel."" I didn't remember the sentence, but it was not profound to me. It was so profound and meaningful to MK that he wrote 300 pages of commentary and praise of it; and in giving me the copy, I noticed it was rather faint Xerox, so faint that I was immediately afraid that it could not be Xeroxed again; and I didn't want to part with the ""original."" I handled the heavy thing, single-spaced and compact and unvarying to the outer edges in style.

"I was near the University. I was outside three shops: paperback bookstore, music hall, and a German restaurant. The students were grouped on the sidewalk: German-speakers in one group. French in one, and Italians in another. Near the French was a girl without legs that was being ignored. I hardly saw her, only 3-4 feet above the cement. I kneeled down and talked to her, suggesting we go to a bench and sit down. She seemed to be on small rollers although I wasn't sure. She propelled herself with her hands or fists. When we got to the bench, I sat, and she lifted herself smoothly up to be beside me. She was wearing a see-thru blouse and no bra; her breasts were small and neat, with nipples nudging the white lace-like cloth. She had her hair in a tight swirl about her head and her skin was fair and freckled. I started the conversation by saying that ""Your arms can do everything better than mine."" I placed my bare arm beside hers and hers was the same size as mine but harder. She said something about being lonely and I said, ""There is no reason for any woman being lonely as long as all her moving parts worked; and I'll bet yours do."" She had a faint smile.

"A woman came to the bed that I was sleeping on but laid on the parquet floor. She lifted her gown and spread her legs: she stroked herself and invited me in--I plunged a few times and just as I came I took out my penis with the semen oozing and shooting onto her stomach--belly button area. I wondered if any went inside, since I didn't know her age or her preparations. I woke up and had had a wet dream--the first in a decade at least.

"I was with ""my"" [imaginary] animals. A white goat, muley--no horns--butted me playfully. I could not tell if the goat was tame or wild. It sort of butted me towards a hilltop. As we went to edge of dry stream bed, the slope down one side and up the other was easy to walk, even though the sparkly sand (volcanic ash?) changed to frost and light snow--not slippery at all. It was crisp to walk in the cold air and hear the quiet crispness underfoot. Above me was my pet male deer, Elk, Moose--it had the largest horns I'd ever seen, all branchy like an open fan. I walked closer, my goat just behind me. I took off my black belt and came closer to its pretty grey-brown neck. I put the belt around it and closed it, with some of strap left over like a handle, fearful because the horn hitting me would kill me with just a twitch of the deer's head and neck.

"I was walking near the city auditorium and church. It is twilight. a police car comes by with large 8 foot by 8 foot board on it with curved edges--like plywood with holes in it, curved as with steam to make it bend into wings. I looked up in the sky and the same piece is sailing upwards where it hovers like a martin, kite, or prehistoric flying monster half a mile up. I assumed it took off when cops came around the corner too fast and an updraft lifted it like a glider. Then it swoops down with a graceful parabolic curve, just clearing my head, and it enters a house ... and I know it is a steel sheet. It goes right through the wall of the house, parallel with porch, through the picture window where I see people playing cards. It travels at table-top level and I assume came to rest beyond the house in an alley. I do not go in, knowing the dead bodies and ugly destruction. I don't want to be a gaping curiosity-seeker. Later I read in a paper where five people killed, when it caught them playing cards in the early evening.

"I'm in China in semi-desert place with American travelers. We seem to be a trade or academic delegation. Suddenly about 500 Chinese walk towards us. I'm uncertain, but not very afraid. Then smiles on those in front rows. One comes forward who knows a little English--a man about my age wearing a little blue-denim Chinese worker's cap. I say slowly that I'm a railroad worker, but lost my job when the volcano exploded. They are feeling sorry for me and express regrets--a ripple of ooos and sighs through the crowd when he translates. Then I name slowly the cities that I may go to in order to find another railroad job. I wonder if they see similarities in American union protection and Chinese socialist protection. Suddenly, I'm in a pasture behind where I lived when I went to college (close to the university, but still we kept two cows). The Chinese are with me. I decide to show them my house and garden so they will see an American place. We walk slowly around the house and I talk about the oak trees they have never seen and the flowers that are new to them. When we get to the front of the house the dream ends.

"I was in desert-like place near a railroad. A ghost-town with old lumber unpainted and worn by blowing sand. One building like a small garage had sunken place in it, rats dived to the bottom like pit of doodlebugs enlarged and squirmed just below the sand. I threw small rocks and gravel to get them up so I could kill them. Suddenly, water rose and a small shower inside the shack--like rain inside the car in the George Burns movie O God. I went outside to see if rats had run away. None. I walked to railroad platform and white rope separating people from station employees had just broken. A friend and boss of mine at railroad repaired it, the way cable is spliced: rope overlapped and U-bolt tightened. I praised him too much I felt; he looked at me oddly for excessive language for small act.

"In the dream I see a movie ad on famous users of drugs and how it harmed them. The picture in the ad looked like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and like an eroded face of Ken Kesey on cover of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The movie opens with effects of drug distortions as seen in head of man in top of Volcano (half eaten away or ash and burned marks or darkness). His hand rested on the mountain and body soared above it into steam and clouds--I assume headless. The dream shifts to asylum/hospital/prison where man/boy is captured by police/evil futuristic uniforms as in Star Wars. He screams as loud as possible, ""Help me, Save me!"" Out of the volcano Christ rises and strides forward in the air, with two helpers or angels, also walking through the air toward the prisoner. Christ has on cape and headdress like monks or St. Francis. But his face was strong. The scene shifts to the outside of the prison (or military base or asylum). At the entrance, a man and two young women are tearing down the signs, MENTAL WARD, RETREAT CENTER. I assume they'll tear down the fence. but the dream ends as they tear the signs off the gate.

Suddenly the woman changes into Henry Miller who sits down with huge books under his arm. They bring him Miller's beer in a can without him saying a word. He is working immediately in the wide margins, giving ""explication du text"" to obscure and rarely played Shakespeare plays--Timon of Athens and Titus Andronicus. He works steadily with a black ink pen--script perfect. I'm impressed that his mind is clear at 88-90. He has galley proofs beside the books. I pick up one with circle of beer can on its edge. It is almost beyond belief that so much learning can come from that ancient mind of Henry Miller--and nothing there except the text of Shakespeare.

When the fishermen raised oysters with face of warrior on them, it was like desecrating a graveyard. So each one with shell that resembled a warrior put back. As the years have continued since 1300, the resemblance to warrior has moved closer and closer. Sagan in his TV show said this was Darwinian selection where Men and Nature were together. In my dream, a scientist said volcanoes erupted at same time. So face like cameo of eroding layers of pink, brown, and mauve volcanic dust to give that effect.

But I looked up and saw I was under a long marble arch, straight like a column on its side and horizontal. It was supported at one end by an urn and a tiny crooked column above it. It looked dangerous. So I moved several yards away. I woke from my sleep as the great 40 yard marble thing started to fall. I just laid there. It landed a foot from my head. I turned and looked at a white marble lion--astounded that its smallest and thinnest parts did not crumble and hit me. I got up to tell someone of my good luck. Suddenly the room was filled with a charity sale, all the garage-sale junk you ever saw there in that room, on tables. People walked around the column on the floor in unconcern. I saw a red-haired guard with freckles who seemed friendly. I walked up to tell of my cleverness that saved my life. He didn't understand English very well, saying he was Ukrainian. And talked mostly in Ukrainian to me, with an English word here and there. So I joined the people looking at the stuff for sale. I looked at Street & Smith pulp westerns, some bound, some loose issues. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in volume sets, one in a large bread wrapper, each book like a slice, others in plastic one beside another, as people carry credit cards. Then a generous neighbor woman came up to me and gave me a beautiful ""heirloom."" It was a glass bowl-vase--between both in height--cut glass, blue glass leaves or painted blue spots here and there. In and around and below the glass dish was silver and gold wire, fine as hair, holding silver and gold leaves. In its bottom was carved in the glass, in red lettering--Sheffeld 1733."" I assumed it had belonged to that famous cutlery family or an aristocrat with that name. I took it to the house where I lived while in college. I set it on a desk in my bedroom. The family paid no attention to me or the bowl since my son Willie had returned home. Emma and the three other children asking many questions, hugging him, and touching him. I looked from the doorway and saw that he had his usual quiet smile, saying nothing. His arms were thin as broomsticks, his neck bent forward, giving him a hint of hunchback. His hair fairly short and very black. One pimple at hairline, just under his left ear. His arms did not have marks of drug user. I wondered if he would go for a good physical. I hoped they would not drive him away with too many questions. I'm happy and unhappy he has returned.

The squirrel goes up the front steps and into the house. I follow and an old man comes in, and a bear cub and the wolf (who is smaller now and not fearful). I look around for something to throw at them. I see mother's flower pots. I throw the smallest and ugliest. It is enough. As it shatters, the old man changes into a big bear and runs away, along with the cub and the wolf that is now a scroungy dog. Mother is standing beside me, smiling and showing me a note the old man had written when he came into the house while I was away. ""I'm a Catholic.""

I comment on his similarity to American English. The man collects donations and while he talks, a man from the Retreat Center, a pastor, gives him a coin wrapped in paper stuffed in folds of his overalls near one of his knees as he is seated. I determine to give him at least a dollar since I have talked with him and used up some of his time. He tells me about the part he played in RAF and battle of Britain. He was burned and was not expected to live. As he says that, I look at his face and it has pink look of old burns and scars .. fishhooks missing. Since he recovered, he decided to dedicate himself to God and honor dead friends and patriots in the war. A young American walks up and hears the talk of his injuries during the war.

I am not amused and since I find a ball-peen hammer in my hand, I throw it at his dancing feet hard as possible. It hits him on the ankle. Immediately he changes to a thin man about 35 who resembles him in skinny body. He continues to dance with my coat, not wanting to give it back. I pick up a stick like a broken pool cue. It is sharp as a spear where the hardwood split on the grain. But I hit him on the ass as if spanking a child. He gives it back, still laughing.

The engine, safely on the tracks, is oiled by a lazy guy who seems to oil empty holes and nuts and bolts that don't need the oil. No interest in his job at all, as if in a trance. The engine then goes up an (impossible) incline to check the power on inclines. There is an iron weight, pear-shaped, with pointer on end and a dial from 1 to 10. It is on 4 when dream ends. It's all very exciting to see the engine at a 45 to 60 degree angle up in the air on the rather flimsy rails.

"There was a convention of all the nations of the world for a ""Walking on the Water"" contest. Before it officially began, a man with seven silk top hats walked briskly down the dock and onto the water. He slowly sank. Each hat was carefully labeled (starting with his head, Historian, Artist, Scientist, Economist, Literary Man, Political Man, and on top was ""Walker on Water."" After he sank, one hat floated, the ""Walker on Water"" and beside it rose to the surface and floated was his pair of sandals. Similar to old stories in the Bible and other primitive lit; in an odd way, this man had won the contest!

"I'm at a football game or music festival with Emma and my mother and father. It is in a Greek-type amphitheater so the top seats are ground level. There I'm to meet our friends Nancy and Joe. We are early. I wonder if we are in the right place and they know where to come. Then I see them standing above us. I go up alone. Nancy has on a see-thru blue blouse (light and airy) and a Navy-blue skirt. She has dark brown hair--between chestnut and brunette. It is sort of upswept, a little like Gibson Girl. Joe is thin and sharp-nosed, a little like William Powell in Thin Man series--no hairline, mustache--both look about 35 to 40. He speaks first, ""I'm hungry."" And I said, ""Go to an Eastern Airline cafeteria. If line is too long, break in at front, if no line, start a new one."" Nancy looks at me and says, ""So this is what professors are wearing these days."" I have on a brown suit and tie. Mother and Dad have extra seats. I slow down as we enter so Joe sits next to Emma, Nancy next to Joe, and I on the outside next to Nancy. I have to find out where they are staying, how long, when they can meet for dinner. Nancy is cool and correct, not revealing plans.

"I'm at the Retreat Center and most of the people around me are old acquaintances. At a meeting in the open, I sit fairly close to the speaker, but off to one side, alone, my own brown wooden table to write on. Later I'm aware of my strength and radiant good feeling and good looks. Young people, about two boys and two girls, all about 20 years old, say I look ""strong and rugged""--not patronizing to old, but straight stuff. I look down and see my Golden Sweat Shirt and smile at the illusion of bulging muscles--it's a baggy monster that disguises my modest muscles. I say nothing to them. A woman is near me--tall and thin and good-looking with shoulder-length hair, a composite to two women I know. We get friendly in a hurry, and she takes off her shoe--we are on the floor on a rug by then, but people still all around us. I kiss the top of her foot, gallantly, not silly or parody. She agrees to meet me later. I sit there a long time alone. A fat child, with dark skin, like mulatto or Mexican comes up and says, ""Marilyn is called away, so she can't meet you at 2 PM by the Gate."" She mumbles and is shy, so I ask her to repeat it. I had heard it right the first time. I was dimly aware I may have forgot the time and place for our assignation. I think about my overtures to the woman and feel I merely want to get naked with her, even if no sex. I feel she will ask if I'm married. I'm resolved to tell her the truth, but will still feel like a cad.

Beckett said, ""I'll not move--here for many years and I'll not change for a stupid new law."" Landlord starts out, but door to front locked with a cheap lock on inside.

He smiles and is immediately not as handsome--teeth uneven and sharp like little fangs of a snake or devil. He comes close and wants to kiss me. I'm shocked because I know he's dead. He's a ghost, handsome as he looks. I turn my head, for fear of what I'll see when he becomes a corpse or skeleton again. He whispers in my ear, ""I want to suck you, go down on you. And you do the same to me."" I want to break away, but he holds me strongly in a grasp, as I continue to look away and keep eyes closed. Then I break his grasp and I wake up, holding myself with crossed arms and a pillow against my stomach and groin, lying on left side.

"Marilyn Monroe is being interviewed. She loves drugs: ""I like J&B; Scotch, uppers, downers, and cocaine."" Then a photograph shows first from knees to navel--she's wearing a slight bikini bottom. As experts talk about her, one says, ""She uses drugs like groceries."" Then the photograph is full-length, and I look at her from waist up, as closely as a doctor looks at an X-ray. Her breasts are big and beautiful at a glance. But on a closer look, they are squarish and lumpy. Instead of a nipple, she has three, like end of a Norelco shaver, with each circle smaller but almost as flat. Not sexy at all. Her breastbone just below her neck is a triangular plate just below the skin--all the skin in the upper area from navel up is transparent, like glass or a film negative or a thick plastic where you can just barely see what it wraps. The plate with a button shape in each corner seems to be silver. Below all her skin I see blood vessels as faint blue and nerves as white wires.

I walk onto the gym floor in my ordinary clothes and shoes and she slides by on her back in a bathing suit. It looks as if talcum powder is on her to make it slippery. I adore her energy and courage. ""Let's have a test of strength by pushing against, hand to hand."" Suddenly she is naked, almost as tall as I and I admire her nakedness. Suddenly another naked woman comes between us--short, plump. I see her back only. She turns slowly and it is a young man. I leave immediately to retrieve my books in the round room. It has filled with women about my age, 60 to 80. I can't find my books under the chair. Just as I see them, and wonder how to get them, the dream ends.

But it was really supposed to be a computer lab. Anyway, sorry about that saw in the background. Anyway, my mother and I were in this room, and she bent something like a computer that makes it really stand out, and she has to get help from Larry. I think this is how it went. It was so complicated, I can't even remember it. But anyway, she makes the computer stand out, and Larry comes up and is criticizing me because I don't ever work with him on anything, and isn't going to help us now. Matter of fact, he threatens to activate the alarm system. And then I think somebody was riding around outside in a little golf cart thing like the administrators do, and for some reason or other we had to get out of there quick because he did something else with the computer that was going to start this virus thing going around the school. And so we got on this golf cart and we just drive, and I didn't recognize, and we went downstairs via the elevator into the library. Then we were talking with the librarian and she said that I had this problem with rocking back and forth, which I don't, but that the problem was common with blind people, but I don't have it. And the librarian said that I had a problem with rocking back and forth and that we needed to work on that.

And I came in wearing a dress. So we found a shorter route that was only a mile, and we got back to the Visitor Center and I kind of lost everybody, so I figured I would stand by the door in the Visitor Center and they would find me eventually. And they did. Sheryl and Sandra came out, pushing this Janebread house that was so big it had to be pushed along on wheels, and it was designed to be eaten on the trail ______ a snack. So Sheryl and Sandra and I only wanted to hike one more mile and my father and Sam and my mother wanted to go ten more miles. So Sheryl and Sandra and I took the short trail and we said we would meet back at the Visitor Center. So Sheryl and Sandra and I started off hiking, pushing this Janebread house that was on wheels, it was so big. And we were eating little cookies and little candies and little nutty things off of it, and was getting top-heavy on the one side, so we had to lay it down. And I was just going to reach for another Jane cookie, and I woke up.

"When we were in my relative's home town a few weeks ago, I had a dream that I was in a reception hall place that kind of looked like our school cafeteria. And I saw this woman sitting at a sound board, which is very unusual, because whenever I see people at sound boards, they're always guys. But anyway, there was a woman at a sound board, and the board wasn't black. It was kind of a light burnt sienna brown with the knobs and things were black. And she wanted me to come over and help her, and she showed me where the power switch was. But she wanted me to find a video input key, and I was looking all over the schematic for it and I didn't see it anywhere. And meanwhile, while I was looking over the schematic for the video input key, she was mopping up and cleaning up the reception hall. And she was sweeping the floor and things. And I said, ""Could you come over and help me find it?"" And she didn't seem to hear me. And then after a while I woke up.

"I had a dream that our receiver wasn't working and that my father got all upset and decided that he didn't want anything to do with it. And so my mother and I were going to fix it by ourselves. And we started working on it, and we got the front left and right channels to work just fine, but no matter what we did, we could not get the rear section to work. And we had a movie on pause while we were doing all of this. And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main building looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Richardsand Ms. Salazarand we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody's class, and then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot, in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Janice that was sitting at the sound board and her and I would talk. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things. And that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends, and I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes. And I would get all nervous and jerky when I would see one. Continued on side 2. I had a dream on the other side of this tape that got cut off. It was about, let's see, I dreamt that dream that got cut off, but the other one, I don't. My father and I were testing out the portable two-way radios to see if they work, because I can't remember if it was Janice, Carol or some other person, or Josie, somebody coming. And we were going to go to the beach with them and we wanted to keep track of them. So we were like testing them out. And the one that I had turned into a cell phone and called somebody's phone number, and we kind of like interrupted them during supper. And then, as we were trying to figure something out, it turned into this like computer keyboard desktop tape recorder type of thing. We were going through and listening to past transmissions and past conversations that it had saved. And this is really a watered-down version, man, this is dumb. And the rest is on the other side of the tape.

I dreamt that I was at Wild Gardens and that my mother was going to have her art show there, and we were walking through some thick foliage and looking at different animals and looking at different people's displays and we decided to go back to the band show and see if they had their sound board set up yet.  So we got back there and there was a rope fence partitioning off this spot of ground where they were going to put the equipment.  And there were a whole bunch of chairs set up, but there was no band and no sound tech, so we kept walking around for a while.  And then we got back, we decided to go back and see if they were set up, and I saw this guy sitting in the spot where the board was supposed to be with the radio, and he said, ""They're not going to have a band today.  They're not going to need me today.""  And then I woke up.

So I asked to go and use the restroom, and I got up and all of a sudden I was in my bedroom looking west into the bathroom, and there was a line of about five people in front of me.

And my mother and my father were going in to look at some things at the music store, too, for a while, and I stayed out because I was tired and I wanted to take a nap, and I turned on the ignition and started listening to the radio.  And I was listening and listening, and before I knew it, it was starting to sound a little weak, and I thought, ""Oh no, here we go.""  And so I shut it off and tried to start the engine, and it wouldn't start.  And I was thinking, ""What am I going to tell them?  Am I going to tell them I was reading the whole time?""  And so I went in and I was looking around with them, and my mother handed me four CDs and said, ""Take these up to the counter.""  Two of them were Christmas orchestra things, one of them was something to do with rap and the other one I couldn't read.  And I was thinking to myself, ""How am I going to tell them it won't start?  Should I just let them discover it or what?""  But I woke up before they really tried to start it.  [This actually happened when I was in middle school: my mother left me in the car, left the radio on, and promised she'd come back in 5 minutes.

So I guess it was reflected in my dream last night.  I dreamt that I was in sixth period in Mr. Truman's class in the main building and that someone had taken one of the alarm boxes off the wall and was holding it in their hand, and this woman grabs me by the hand and says, ""Come on, let's get out of here.  It's going to sound any minute now.""  And so we got out, we were running down the stairs as fast as we could run, and all of a sudden I was hanging in mid-air and I couldn't run anywhere.  And I was climbing these bars to get down the stairs, and then I ran out onto the football field and the alarm finally went off when I got out there.

And something about the humidity is way too high and the fumes are way too high. And I thought, ""That is really weird.""

"Last night's dreams are a little fuzzy in my mind. I remember living somewhere seemingly far away from my own home- most likely somewhere in the country, but I don't really remember any buildings. I remember meeting two girls there who I thought I had met once previously (in dreams, I guess, maybe the same night). For some reason I wanted to be really friendly with them, and I felt some kind of personal attachment. I don't remember much about them, except that they lived far away (Although it seemed I was far away from home, I think they were even further), and I wanted to keep contact with them. Then, I was away from them for some reason, and I was thinking of things I wanted to ask them next time I saw them, such as if I could have their address/email address and if they wanted to stay ""friends forever"". Then, when I went to look for them, they were gone- just left, gone back home. At that time I was in a house that very much resembled my grandfather's house (dreams are weird in that you always know something looks familiar, but can only guess if that wasn't what it was supposed to be, or if you really did make that connection in the dream). There was a small van (it was definitely the same van we went to the college Model UN in), and I saw someone get inside, Mr. Rosetti I think. And as far as I knew, we were going into the city for a school trip. On the van (which seemed more like a really big, fancy bus when I got in there), there was a guy lecturing us about something. I was so tired, half-asleep within my dream; and it was a weird situation. It was kind of like a partial dream within a dream. The lecturer asked a question, and in my ""dream"" I imagined I knew the answer so I raised my hand, and when he finally called on me, I said I didn't know the answer, and I only raised my hand because I was half asleep and I imagined either I knew the answer or that he was asking a different question.

So, I was complaining to my school principal, trying to take apart the lyrics and explain why they were offensive to me. Of course, I wasn't really at all offended by this newspaper submission, but I still complained to the principal, Mrs. Lear, about it.

I remember being in my bedroom or one much like it, and many frail looking boys coming in- many of them wearing the smallest bit of clothing. I felt rather bad for them, and realized how hard it would be for me to live like that. There were at least 2 beds in the room, and about 5 or 6 boys got into each bed. It also seemed like it would be too crowded if I also got in the bed- I'd barely fit, and I like having room. All I remember thinking is that since there were so many people on the beds, I'd rather sleep on the floor. They didn't say a word. Then I'm in a hotel. Certain doors I wasn't able to open, maybe.

"I dreamed I was walking through the middle of New York City, yet it didn't really look too much like a city. There weren't enough tall buildings and people. I came to this area with a bunch of homeless kids, and one of the boys asked me if I'd be willing to trade a dollar for a quarter. After looking into my pocket I found I had several hundred dollars with me, so I gave him my dollar. I told him he could keep the quarter but he gave it to me anyway. There was a girl, who upon seeing a bowl on top of a trailer, wondered if there was any food in it. Unfortunately, I had to answer that there wasn't any food in the bowl. Then the idea came to me that I could take her out of that ghetto area, I could show her a better life, and we could have some fun. So I asked her if she'd like to come with me, and I admitted I had some money. She said she would. For some reason one of her friends came with us too. We were walking, and I decided to ask for her telephone number. She gave me a really weird answer, although it did start with my area code; it was something like: 611-832f-9,dt. I told her I didn't know there was a comma on the telephone, and she told me she didn't either (after looking at the telephone, I found it was one of five or six symbols below the ""0"" key). She told me that was the number for her dorm, or something like that, but I didn't even think that she's homeless and probably wasn't old enough to go to college. I lost sight of her at one point and decided to call her on one of the many nearby phones. Of course, when I called the number you can expect that I'm not really calling a telephone, I'm calling HER- that is, the nearest telephone to her would probably ring. But I guess just about when I picked up the phone, she came into view and I told her I'd been looking for her. So, then we went to the amusement park, and got on a ride where you're sitting down, up to your waist in water. I don't know what the ride was supposed to do. But at that point, the girl (if, in fact, I did know her name, it was probably Julia, because that's the first name that comes to mind when I thought of her), the girl started floating in the air. It seemed a rather normal experience, and I said, ""Oh, no, how do we stop her from floating?"" I don't remember what happened after that, except that she was gone. Then, just outside the amusement park, there was a computer, a very eccentric type of computer. I was typing song lyrics into the computer. They were my own song lyrics, and I was amazed that I was typing really good lyrics without really thinking about what I was typing. I often try to write song lyrics in real life, but they never sound just right, even though I think deeply about what I'm going to write. But here, miraculously, these perfect song lyrics were being typed out by me (I'm not sure how good they would have sounded if I heard them in the physical world). There was an interesting little program on this computer that allowed me to integrate the lyrics into an actual song, just by pressing a button. The lyrics sounded excellent when put to music- in fact, I think the voice I heard singing my lyrics was none other than Steven Page, lead vocalist for Barenaked Ladies. It was my own song, yet it sounded like something Barenaked Ladies might have done- one of my real life goals (to write a song comparable to Barenaked Ladies)! Well, the next thing I remember is being in a room, and seeing the girl that just floated away on me. There were a few other people there, and I just sat down, on a couch opposite the one she was sitting on, and waved.

"My first memory was seeing this blonde girl that looked familiar. When I asked for her name, she said Michelle, and I playfully jumped on her. When she acted surprised, I said, ""Oh, sorry, I thought you were another Michelle."" She said her name was Michelle. (There is a senior at my school with the same last name, but I donÕt know anyone named Michelle.) Yet the name sounded very familiar, even to the point that I checked my old yearbook for someone with that name after I woke up (without success). In my dream, she was probably related to Alex in some way, and she was a shadow at Prep Academy. I wanted her to shadow me, but she went with someone else instead. I was supposed to be in class, but went into another room to look for Michelle. Instead I found some people, presumably teachers, since the one person I knew was Mr. Grant (Some of the others seemed to know me, and shook my hand, but I didn't recognize them).

"I was walking through a hospital, and there were people on life support. The cords connecting them to the support went through the only place that I could walk through, and since the lights were rather low, I was afraid I might accidentally knock out one of the plugs, or someone might trip on them. Then there were 2 teachers, Mrs. Pappas and Mr. Dell. I think Mrs. Pappas told me to turn a dial or press a button, but I didn't hear whether she said DON'T press the button, or press it. I didn't know what the button was for, but I thought it might have some crucial consequence if I didn't follow her directions. So I called her, as she was walking away, and she didn't answer. Mr. Dell was walking behind her, so I called Mr. Dell, and he said he'd get Mrs. Pappas to come back to tell me what to do, but she never did, as far as I remember. Then I remember sitting at a table, probably outside, and eating, with Mrs. Saint and some others. All I remember is that I couldn't hear much, and I had to keep asking these kids at a nearby table to repeat what they were saying to me- when I did, some people just laughed and told me to forget it, but I really wanted to know what they were talking about. I felt excluded. I also remember Mrs. Jones showing me something outside the school. I don't remember what it was. Probably I had this dream because when I fell asleep, I'd just gotten back from Plainview High School and I'd seen my old teachers.

"I remember not really being involved for most of this dream. Like a movie, where I'm there, but just watching, and nobody else notices I'm there. It was about a boy, and I think a girl, either his sister or mother probably. The boy is being taken somewhere through the ceiling of the basement (that I think is my grandfather's basement) by an evil superman look-alike. The girl doesn't know what's happening to her little brother/son. There was more, but it's so foggy in my memory I can't describe it. The next thing I know, I'm in my kitchen, and there's a bunch of people there- an electrical unit or something near the door, from what I remember (although I don't know what that has to do with anything), and we sort of ""slid"" out of the house. I don't exactly remember, it was almost like a waterslide, maybe. Then, I fell until I was at the other side of the driveway and then suddenly realized I had no clothes on. At that point, everybody was getting ready to start a fantasy baseball draft. The first draft pick went to the ""Jethros""- i.e. Jethro Tull (last guitar lesson, I told my guitar teacher I didn't really like Jethro Tull and he said he's never heard of anyone who didn't).

"Most of the dream takes place at night. I'm running continuously through a place that looks sort of like my town. I half realize I'm dreaming, but not really. I just remember thinking that it's so easy to run in a dream without getting out of breath, and how fun running is in dreams. Although it looked a lot like my town, I get a feeling at some point I was a long way from my hometown. I just remember asking someone where the bank was. Since I knew I was dreaming, I wanted to rob a million dollars from the bank and ""play liar liar"" was what I called it (I don't exactly understand why, except that in the movie ""Liar Liar"" Jim Carey played the part of a lawyer who couldn't tell the truth). Having fun playing cops and robbers in my sleep, for real. I never got to the bank or anything. Again, if I really knew I was dreaming, I would have known that I didn't need money in the dream world and just done whatever I wanted. Oh, there were also a few things about lucid dreaming I thought up, during my dream. I remember thinking, at one point during my dreaming, ""I wonder if I can hypnotize myself while I'm dreaming so I'll be different in some way when I wake up,"" and someone told me that thinking of some of your idiosyncrasies in real life will make your dream stronger when it's fading. Somehow it worked for me, but it was so crazy, it probably worked only by the power of suggestion (besides, I was thinking of things like, ""I don't shower enough"" as idiosyncrasies).

"I dreamed I was in a big room, with lots of people. There were tables, but I didn't see any food. Bernice was there, and there is a brief sexual scene between us. I guess we were in school, or at a school event, because after that, I was very afraid that everyone had seen and that I could be kicked out of school. I pretended the whole thing was ""a show,"" walking around to every table asking everyone ""how do you like the show?"". I didn't feel like anyone was there at the time. I felt ""they"" were looking for me, and would catch me any minute. Then there was a girl who I sat next to, and told her what a surprise, that I'll love her forever (and I don't just say those things, believe me, I really mean them. I sound like Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye, I know- but I know exactly how that kid felt). Then I heard somebody call my name, and I knew I'd be in huge trouble. The strange thing, though, is that it wasn't my name. I can't remember what they called me, but it seemed natural like it was really my name. So, I brought this girl through the nearest door and downstairs. I kept telling her to run faster, but I didn't run away because I felt safer with her around. As far as I remember, I got out. Then, I remember thinking I had woken up, and coming outside my house to see a school bus in my driveway. I thought the bus might have been from my dream, and realized in that case it could have been from anywhere in the world. I looked at the location on the side, and it said it was from somewhere in CA, which, instead of making it out to mean ""West Coast,"" I thought it meant ""Central America."" I also remember getting a phone call and being called into the studio of the radio station ABCD at the nearby university- but it wasn't a small studio room, it was more like a big gymnasium. If I remember, not everybody had all their clothes on (some of the guys had their shirts off, I think) and the main guy there reminded me of one of the early morning guys on WAAF.

"The first thing I remember is holding a CD in my hand, and then all of a sudden being able to hear the music perfectly in my head. I was amazed by my ability, although I wasn't sure if I thought I was awake or asleep at the time. I don't remember what disc I was listening to either, but I do remember my brother saying something about a band called ""[something] Hill"" and then I thought about the band Sugar Hill that DC Talk sings about on one of their albums. So, I think I was going to put my DC Talk CD into the player. At that point, I remember going ""unconscious""- I started seeing pictures in my head or something, and I really felt like it was another form of consciousness. The next thing I know, I'm in my bed reading. I come across this passage, but I never really know what it's saying because every time I read it I go unconscious. I read this passage several times, but I'm never able to finish because I just black out to another world, temporarily (it only seemed like a few seconds each time). Anyway, finally I was able to read most of it, and I remember something to the general effect of (paraphrasing): ""According to the research of [John Smith], every time [certain phrase] is written, people are proven to go unconscious, because when you really believe something, it will happen."" I think I still blacked out, even after the disappointment of somebody actually TELLING me that this technique was just a placebo (I really could have killed that guy for spoiling it!), but at least I was able to read more of it that time- enough to understand what it was saying.

I remember thinking, ""WHY DOESN'T SHE TELL US ABOUT THESE THINGS BEFOREHAND!"" IÕm searching for my problems, and a pen and everything and I couldn't even find everything. Then, I remember her giving me a paper that said pretty much, ""I'm very disappointed in you, I don't even know why you're here."" There was something else in this dream sequence, something a little more positive (maybe it wasn't, but that's my waking impression).I don't really remember that part.

Then, (now dream within dream) I remember thinking I was lucid, and I was somewhat lucid. I saw some words posted somewhere- I tried to memorize them so I'd remember then when I woke up. I don't remember what the words were, except the letter ""E"" was probably the first letter in two of the words, and there were 4 words I memorized. Then I remember being in or near a nurse's office, and then going through this room with a 4 foot ceiling and dust floors, where a lot of army men were eating and hanging out. I was just glad I wasn't in the army, and as I left the room I tried very hard not to get dusty. I had a strange feeling that I was at camp or something, and I wasn't going to be able to wash for a while.

Well, I thought, again ""wait a minute, I'm lucid, I shouldn't be doing this!"" (standing there doing nothing) and then I thought I'd conjure this girl that I remember from 3 1/2 years ago. I remember using my hands and saying her name, trying to get her to appear. Nothing happened. Then I thought of another ""method of execution""- (I'd decided once in waking life that, if you want something you can't do yourself in a dream, you've gotta ask somebody else- especially a wise man or mystic or someone who knows what they're doing!). So, I'd ask the lady behind the counter if she knew where this girl was.

Something gave me the impression of my grandfather's neighborhood, but it didn't look anything like it, after recalling it. There was a black bag, filled with something (books?), and I think I tripped over it and almost fell into the water- I grabbed onto a pole attached to the bridge so I didn't fall, and I remember the word ""leer""- Spanish for ""to read"" flashing before my eyes.

"All my family members were out of character: my grandfather was setting up a marriage between myself and someone I've never met. I really didn't want to do it, but I wanted to know if I might possibly have known that person, and I was extremely curious as to what the whole thing was about. I was promised we'd go out to eat afterwards, if it got over early enough. It didn't- I don't think she ever showed up (I never expected her to), and I was upset- I had my mind set on a certain restaurant, and when I found out we had to eat at home, I was furious. Then, we were at home and my family went out for something. I remember trying to make strawberry milk while they were gone- I started using hot water from the faucet, and then when I realized it was regular milk, not meant to be hot, I tried to turn on the cold water but the coolest it got was luke warm. I didn't want them to catch me making strawberry milk, although my brother was there. Then, my family was home, and I noticed I was naked, so I grabbed a towel from the doorknob before they walked into the door. (Then, I was in my kitchen. It was night, and being slightly lucid at this time, I asked my mother to teach me telekinesis. Then, I also mentioned wanting to learn to materialize objects in a dream. She tried to teach me how to open and close the cabinet door without touching it. Also, she gave me a ""magic paintbrush"" that would change pictures and writing on paper, automatically. I asked about real things and I was amazed that it worked from a distance. (But now, I remember all it did was add small stars to the cabinet door. I wasn't thinking of anything to reproduce at that time, so that might be the problem.) So, at that time I left the door with my paintbrush (which I never used again). I didn't really like the idea of a paintbrush- I would rather have just learned to close my eyes to materialize something. Anyway, I was soon in a strange land that looked more like a game reality than real life. I was starting to feel completely lucid. I asked myself some questions about my waking life, but I couldn't think of which questions to ask. There was this part of the environment that was underwater- you'd have to open a door and swim into it. Amazingly the water didn't drain out into the other room (I guess it wasn't so amazing at the time). As I swam through the area, a voice said, through an intercom: ""At this point, the water is only about 8 feet deep, which is exceedingly low compared to the rest of the ocean."" is a good paraphrase. It did look a lot like an ocean- lots of underwater plants and creatures. On the other side, I saw my cousin. I told her she was dreaming, and she said, ""No, I'm not."" I gave her reasons to believe it was a dream. Then I said, ""Can people fly?"" ""Yeah,"" she said. Someone else jumped about 3 inches into the air, trying to demonstrate. I thought they might have thought I meant ""in an airplane"" or something like that. So I said, ""watch"" and I flew about 3 or 4 feet into the air, as easy as can be, and came down. Then, after running out of things to say, and reasons why she could be in a dream, I told her, ""Here, think about it, and if you end up realizing you're in a dream, when you wake up CALL ME."" Then I patted her on the back, and left. I came to this place with a lot of seats, and a lot of people. Then I came to this really cute, little black girl who might have just been sitting down, but I thought was in a wheelchair. I thought I knew her, and she thought the same. I kissed her on the cheek and asked her how she was. She asked me why I came back. I didn't really understand what she was asking (I thought maybe she was mistaking me for someone else), but I told her, ""to see family and friends."" Then I told her, ""You're one of my best friends in the worldÉ no, you ARE my best friend."" And I promised her I'd be back to spend more time with her. At that point I felt like I knew her. Then, I was walking and I remember feeling slightly dizzy in the head. Everything was still very clear, but I could tell I was losing consciousness and wouldn't be in the dream much more than a few seconds. So I sat on the ground and took hold of a table. Then I remembered the spinning theory, and spun on my feet for a while. I was trying to remember all this for when I woke up, and I remember recording that I was spinning for 30 seconds. After that, I wasn't feeling dizzy any more. I don't remember what happened after that, or I might have just woken up anyway.

I talked to Frank about it, and he asked me if I was hearing the ""beating trumpets"". For some reason, the thought of any instrument with that description- very ominous, ""beating trumpets""- frightened me. I told him yes, because he just brought it up, and he got terribly afraid, curling back in fear. The way in which he did this was actually humorous, when I think about it. He was about to run away, and I was really afraid and needed him with me at that point. I wanted to just relax and watch TV together. I didn't want to be alone so I told him, ok, I'm not hearing the sounds anymore. He came back and I asked, ""Is that music coming from the tv?"" Everyone else thought it was a dumb question. Well, actually everybody laughed, thinking I was joking. I think Warren responded that it was coming from the TV. Then I was in a building that I made out to be the ""QRS Video Store"" and tape rentals were less than $1. I had money to buy one, so I rented a video. I don't remember which one or if I even knew at the time. Next, I'm in a big, old, general or surplus store where most of the place wasn't even being used. There were a couple sections where I could buy CD's, and I'd been wanting to replace my Moxy Fruvous CD that I lost (really) so I thought I'd buy one, but wasn't sure between that and another CD I wanted. Then, on the way back, I'm with my school and we get on this floor space that turns into a whitewater raft. All of a sudden there are like 8 people on the raft, which I made to be way too much.

I thought by that by that time the dog was undoubtedly dead, but found that he was still breathing and making noise. I was furious at the fox for doing this to the poor dog. There was a car trying to get through, and I carefully moved the dog to the side of the road. I really didn't think the dog would make it, and I was almost hoping for someone to put him out of his misery but I really wanted to protect the dog and was hoping that he just might be ok. I picked up the fox, who gave a good fight and had claws, but I had to get him away from the dog so he didn't hurt him any more. Then I attempted to throw the fox as far as possible. In the dream, I assumed the fox to be ok anyway, and if I threw him over a fence, he might be hurt just enough so that he didn't go after the dog anymore.

I remember going up to my old female teacher, in this outdoor sort of library place, and I started asking her if she knew anything about the ""S's"" and she said they have a long family history of witchcraft and she knew them well. I found Jenny S. was a lot like Jamie in many ways, from one of the books. The whole thing was almost like a mystery I was figuring out. Then I found Jamie lying down. I asked her to get up, and she said she'd been sunburnt or something like that. Still, I tried to persuade her to get up, which she did. When she found out I was researching her family history, I think she felt I was betraying her. Then I remember having a guinea pig, or other little creature in my hand. Some people told me to go over by the lake, which I did and soon realized it wasn't the best idea- people were throwing rocks at me (people I knew and didn't trust). It was hard to get away from the lake without falling in. I was just hoping that the little animal wouldn't be hurt at all. The animal and I both ended up being fine. Then I was in either Spanish class or history class. The teacher was sort of a mix between a Dell and a Lamacchia (at first he was more like Dell, gradually becoming more like Mr. Grant). I guess I'd chosen to do my final Spanish exam again because I didn't think I did very well the first time. I did even worse the second time, however. Then we were playing something on the board, something like the ""Wheel of History"" game we used to play in Mr. Grant's class, but not quite. Then I remember playing ""hide and go seek."" Everyone was going around and hiding, or something, and I went into this small room where I found Jamie. I couldn't describe what, but I knew she looked different. I kept telling her I was only there to be her friend and listen to her.

"We're in Europe, I'm tired, and Mr. Dell is reading off his plan of everything we're going to do that day. We're leaving one hotel to go to another, but I think it's ok to leave my luggage there, for some reason. The next thing I know, we're on what I think is a bus, and in the back they tell me that I left my cats at the hotel. I think Mr. Dell gave them to me, but they were all tied up so they couldn't go anywhere, like one of their legs was attached to the face by rope. It looked very uncomfortable and I felt bad for them. Then I think I put them in a bathtub that was there, and Mr. Rosetti comes walking by. All of a sudden the cats are little insects (one of them was a small pig), but I didn't think anything of this change. So Mr. Rosetti walks into the bathroom, sees the insects, and I know exactly what he's about to do. I shout ""NO!!!"" but it's too late and I start screaming and crying hysterically, ""You killed my cat!!! You don't understand that was my cat!!!"" So I'm crying and walking up toward the front of the bus telling everybody what happened, and Monica hugs me and I suddenly feel better, not even sure if I remember what had just happened, and I say, ""You comfort me.""

"Prep Academy group project- I was building a mini-vehicle (farm vehicle maybe) of some sort. All of a sudden the rest of the project crashes to the floor. I look to see what's still ok, but I see everything is broken and start laughing, unable to stop myself. I woke up a few times (or at least had false awakenings) and I was confused. The room I was in didn't completely look like my bedroom- but it really could have been a real awakening. Anyway, I also remember what was almost definitely a false awakening- trying to break my bedroom window with telekinesis. All of a sudden I wake up, and I'm looking at the real window.

"I remember a violent dream about someone trying to hurt Janice with a knife or similar device. I don't remember much of this, but the next thing I know, a guy across the street from my house is aiming a gun at me. I get behind someone else, or try to escape, but I can't move very fast. I think I wake up. I fall back asleep. At this time, I've found a gun somewhere, and I pull the safety so now if I push the trigger, it will shoot. I try to figure out how to put the safety back on because I'm afraid I'll shoot somebody. I almost pull the trigger a couple times. I go outside, and my cats are out there- I accidentally aim the barrel at them. I want to shoot the gun somewhere safe. I'm heading over toward my shed and the gun starts to shake a bit. Extremely hot liquid comes out of the gun, and it hurts- I feel it's punishment from God for something- I think I hear a voice from ""God"" saying this. I try to shoot, but my hand is numbing. I feel the gun is about to blow up, so I throw it. It blows up, I run inside the house, and it sounds and looks like a series of bombs going off. I'm afraid, it's starting to bomb right next to my house and it's penetrating. The house is about to start on fire. I'm right near the phone and call ""911"". I wake up. I fall asleep. Then, I'm in Europe again- I don't remember exactly what was going on, except that a group of us were traveling through Europe. I remember being in France, and possibly Italy and Germany. We're doing a lot of walking (mostly through fields and forest; I don't remember walking through any cities or areas of civilization) and it's an adventure. I offer to carry this tired girl on my back for a while, and it didn't really take much effort. Then I realized that maybe she wanted to come down and walk a bit, and so I let her down. I don't remember exactly who it was- it could have been Bernice, Monica, Janice- most likely Bernice. But anyway, I remember being in this restaurant, trying to order some food. I can only find Italian Lire and other currencies but I need French Francs. Then, I'm still walking but almost home. I'm at this house not very far from my house, and this guy is begging for money outside. I don't remember exactly what happens but I give him money, then go inside his house for some reason, and then he threatens to shoot me and I'm running out really fast.

"The first thing I remember is ""rendering reality."" I don't exactly remember what this entailed the first time I did it, although it involved technology and made the world look much more ""real"". (It's dark, and I'm outside my house). In another part of the dream or sequence I did it a second time though, where turning on 6 switches (2 rows of 3) on the doorway of my house changed the amount of light streetlights were giving out (and changed the number of streetlights that were giving out light. This time I'm disappointed, because it's still very dark. The last time I remember doing this ""reality rendering"" it got very light, so I could see everything around me. This time it wasn't nearly as bright- maybe as bright as a normal waking life streetlight. There were other lights that seemed to be coming from the sides, and the sky, which were not as strong as the normal streetlights but there were many of them and my switches controlled these. Then, I remember eating with some people from my school and forgetting my sandwich at or near the table (coming back to grab it later). A phone call from some girl at school, telling me something, none of which I remember. I thought I knew her by her voice, but by the end of the call I wasn't sure. I go outside, and I am walking (or flying) out to a city that is only a few streets away from my house. I want to use a computer to do some ""reality rendering,"" but I find there are some problems with the computer. I do, however, remember a plastic strip that might have contained electrical information to be read by the computer on the geography of the physical world (which could be used to change my dream world into an exact copy of, or even into the physical world). At this time I am not aware I'm dreaming, consciously, but I am conscious enough to know it's a dream. Somebody tells me to wait around- somebody will try to fix the computer. I decide I'm in a dream, and don't really need this rendering mechanism. I decide I'm going to go and have some fun while I can. In the next segment, I'm leaving my house, suddenly become really lucid, and I head up to Katherine's house. On my way there (it's just a few houses down from mine), there's a man driving a truck down Oak Road, who I hear is looking for retribution on old enemies (from a telepathic voice, or something). I'm a little scared, but I'm not sure it's me he's angry at. I'm not sure I'm still lucid. He drives right up into the driveway or yard of the brown house on the left, hastily turns back toward me, this time with the steering wheel on the opposite side from me. He gets out, and I find it's Joe Pesci. He starts shooting a gun at me, and I try to use his truck as a shield, pleading with him not to kill me. I don't remember what happens, but he shot a lot of bullets and none of them hit me. Then, I'm walking down a street. There are some other people there (friends, dream friends, I don't know). I see my grandfather's old car, and upon coming closer to inspect it, it's not the same car. Then I walk into Gail's house, where there are various people there. I can't really see very well, and wonder if it has anything to do with just having been in the bright sun. I ask for Gail and someone directs me to the right into another room. She's sitting or laying down on the floor. I touch her face, but I can barely feel it. My lockmold* isn't very strong. I have a short conversation with her about a movie and say, ""Do you wanna act it out?"" I wake up, realizing it's 11:00 a.m.

"I am entering Plainview High School, and I have a big duffle bag with me (which I soon lose). I decide to attend some classes since the school year is almost over, and nothing can happen to me for not turning in homework assignments since it's not really my school. I see the classes posted on an electronic board, but I don't know the period with which we're starting. Soon I'm in a section of the school which I've never seen before in waking life, but I think I've seen it at least once before in a dream. There are a lot of stairs going down, and suddenly there is a discontinuity in the stairs for about 10 vertical feet, and below there are more stairs. I don't remember trying to ""jump"" down to the other set of stairs in this dream, but I think I might have jumped in another dream. Now I am in a room, which looks somewhat like it could be either the library or the art room. They are taking pictures of two people at a time, for some reason. I think it has something to do with a project we are doing. I think I'm trying to dance, and then I move over to the other side of the room to dance. Barry and Stephanie are dancing to some different type of music. They tell me what it's called (and I don't remember the name), but it sounds to me like some really fast moving heavy metal. I start dancing with Stephanie and I realize how fun dancing to this type of music is. I think she's surprised that I'm actually dancing to it, but I don't remember exactly what I think she's thinking at the time. Then, she goes out into the hallway, and there is a bed down at the end. I don't remember if she's angry at me, or what was going on, but I see her under the sheets and ask her if I can take them off. She said I could, so I pulled them off her face. I complimented her until she got up, and I think started crying. She walks over to the nearest room, tells (the teacher?) that she's sorry for everything she might have done (over the course of forever?). I think I've done something to allow her to change, and I feel good for that reason. Now I'm in another room where people are bouncing on this (air or water filled?) wrestling ring type of thing. I'm inside, and when Louise comes in I'm disappointed (although she looks more ""innocent"" than she usually does- maybe she looks like someone else I know). I get out, and the next thing I remember is seeing Riley I try to be funny, but nobody seems to think what I'm saying is funny. He makes a certain comment, and I run into a small food store, thinking it's appropriate humor based on what he just said, but nobody's laughing. I see a big, chocolate cupcake (which in the dream I call a ""muffin""), and I want to buy it. I have some money in my pocket and I ask how much it costs. The lady says somewhere between $3 and $4, and since I have a $5 bill I give it to her. I'm surprised it costs under $5. I also remember Mr. Pons trying to rush a bunch of us into a bus, and I remember not having my bag and wanting to look for it. I I rush back into the school to try to get it in time to catch the bus. I don't remember if I ever found my bag, but I did forget to go back to the bus.

All of a sudden there are a lot of people around me (mostly girls), and I don't know why. There's a small wheeled chair type device there, and I get on and ask Eva to push me, as fast as she can. She pushes me really fast, and it's very fun. Then I see I'm about to hit a wall and I somehow don't get hurt. Mrs. T. tries to explain something to me, which I don't think I really understand at the time, but looking at my schedule, I see somewhere, for some reason, it says something like, ""pregnant dog"" and I remember that Mrs. T. was trying to explain that to me. I still don't know what it meant, though.

I am now in a large group of people, and there are Nazi's around trying to throw bombs at us. For me, it's a life and death situation. I start running, and I'm not hit. All of a sudden I hear (something like): ""13 deaths; 53 injuries,"" and I'm wondering how they knew that already, less than a second after the bomb has exploded. Then I'm wondering if they have spies for each and every one of us, keeping track of personal information. This scared me, because they knew exactly where I was, and that I wasn't hurt in the last bomb attack (so maybe they'll make an extra effort to get me in the next one). I return, and people start kidding me because apparently, I had been running with Albert Einstein and the Nazi's didn't want to bomb him because of the great benefit he's been to society and science. Since I was with him, they didn't want to take a chance at bombing me and killing both of us. So, Mr. Einstein served well to keep me alive. I found a little bird, extremely tiny, in my living room. I picked him up, trying to look for a box to put him in, because I feared for his safety. Then, I saw the mother bird, and my grandfather's cat, Doc, in the bathroom. I didn't think Doc would try to attack the bird, then got nervous and picked her up. I don't remember what happened. I remember a mouse (did Doc turn into a mouse?) and putting it in the bathtub, heating it like a microwave for some reason, and then looking for the mouse- which I couldn't find afterwards. Then, I'm home from school. Then I'm at German customs, and I've forgotten my passport at home (maybe this takes place directly after the Paris conflict, I donÕt remember). I see a telephone, and try calling home. I keep dialing wrong. I see my brother, my father, and my uncle here, and I want to pretend I don't know them. I call my mother and she tells me she knew I'd forget my passport. My uncle asked if I had it, but she assumed I did and didn't check before I left. Now, I think those three might have brought my passport, but they don't talk to me, and they don't give it to me.

In there!"" and spits a lot of saliva on me. I go in to use a sink to wash myself off, and the guy comes into our room and says, ""Ok, I want everybody on their beds! Face down! Right now!"" I really didn't like this, and was thinking about calling my mother to take me away from this place, or just running away. There was no telling what this guy would do to me if I stayed. Then, as soon as he left the room, I called this girl from the other side of the room over to my bed. The big man comes in again, this time a bit more subdued and smiles, saying to me something like, ""I know you like girls, but..."" in sort of a joking manner, but still with the kind of attitude that could start going crazy again any minute. Then, these two little girls each give me flowers. (Each of them is upset that the other gave me flowers.) One of the sets of flowers was small. The other was a bit bigger, and had writing in Spanish and French on it, with her phone number, email address, and I don't remember what else. I thanked both of them. I then remember climbing up the stairs to this really nice mansion, castle, or house. I don't remember the details. I'm holding Ruth's hand as we climb the stairs. I don't remember what happens in there, but when we come up, I see a colorful brick wall, painted with perfect yellows and reds. There were beautiful trees and a beautiful sky. Everywhere was beautiful. There are knobs somewhere. Somebody tells me to turn the knobs so that the scenery becomes brighter. I do, and it gets brighter and brighter. There's a different knob for every color. Then I make the greens brighter (although I think it would look better with a darker green). When the scenery is sufficiently brightened, a girl that I know very well (I can't remember who it is now) and her boyfriend are having some kind of competition. I hug her, and wish her good luck. I love her, but I'm not terribly jealous about her having another boyfriend. A scene I just remembered upon taking a shower this morning. It's another one of those ""going back to Plainview High School to take classes not because I have to but because I can"" dreams. I remember waking up (in a dream) at 9:00 in the morning. Lawrence was there, and he asked me if I was getting up. I was awake, but I had to do something before going to school, and I assumed it might not be until 9:30. According to him, the bus doesn't come until around 9:30. I remember going to the bus. I'm on the street and it went right by me and turned left. Somehow, though, I got to school. I remember Eva and Martha there- among one or two other people who I can't remember. We were writing a song. When it came time to play the song, I realized I had wasted my time painting a picture or working on some kind of 3D model. I was supposed to be doing percussion. Later I found maybe 10 different percussion devices around the room and realized I could have used those. Eva did a great job with piano. At this time I want to go down to Mrs. T's room to play around with 3D Studio.

I don't remember looking in the mirror throughout this dream, but I remember feeling ""like myself"" and I didn't think I'd look any different anyway. Back in the girls' room, I sit on a couch, trying not to give away the possibility that I might not be a girl. I'm on a chair and pick up and look at a deck of cards or something similar. Then I go over to another couch where one of the girls is watching TV or something, and I decide to relax and get some sleep. Then all of a sudden Mr. Dell and Sara are in the room. I saw her, and hoped she wouldn't recognize who I was. Then we were playing a game of some sort, and Sara chose me (""James"") as the first one to go. I just sat there, hoping nobody would think that male name was mine.

"I'm at a DSA event. I think it was supposed to start at 5:00 but it's dark and I wonder if I'll even be awake by the time the thing is over. I remember flags, a state flag, for example, and I think it was something of a military game. I go over to what I think now is a water well. What happens there, I don't remember, but I like it. Then, I'm walking around a house or building and become lucid. I try to think logically and quiz myself, which increases my awareness and consciousness. Then, I tell myself to do an addition problem like 17 + 28 and I feel fully capable of doing the problem although I don't want to take the time to figure it out. I see writing on the walls, which doesn't make much sense. The individual words make sense but I can't make out the sentences. Then, I remember a sign that said ""Metal Still"" or something of the sort, and I wanted myself to remember it when I woke up. I see the well I was at earlier near the back of the house. I think this is the house where the three girls from the previous dream are living. I look for an entrance but I can't find it.

It's a weird thought; I don't remember it clearly. Then I walk upstairs and I hear the word ""aging"" and in my bedroom is a documentary of the aging process of my grandfather's young cat, Doc. It's not a video documentary, it's like a small museum. I remember seeing either pictures of or 3D representations of Doc all over the room.

I don't ever remember seeing the actual performance start, though). There's a motorcycle around, and I decide to either ride it around or move it somewhere. Then I remember running through a gate over to some other building, but I don't remember what I did there. I'm back, it's dark, and Laura wants to ""demonstrate"" something. There's a loud television or jukebox or something making too much noise. I try to turn it down and the volume won't work. I do turn a knob which starts to cover the ""screen"" with a (wooden?) cover, and it makes slightly less noise, but it's still too loud. Now I remember being at the top of the high hill behind the beach, and watching a beautiful ocean scene. ""My motorcycle"" is there, and someone else in a motorcycle pulls up. I thought he might think I stole it just by looking at it, or else he'd ask me a couple questions about my particular motorcycle and I'd have no idea what he was talking about, get suspicious, and nail me anyway. I just decided to leave the motorcycle there, and quietly climb down the hill to the beach, as if that's what I was planning on all along. But I think the guy starts to chase me, and I'm running through huge crowds, and a lot of people are trying to catch me, many more than I thought knew that I took the motorcycle. So, I'm running (""beach"" is really a brick or stone floor) diagonally toward the water. I could decide to go through the gate too, but something tells me the water might be safer.

"I see Mrs. Wallace (art teacher) and she's talking to other art teachers about how the ""art classes"" she teaches is really basic mathematics. I don't think I take that literally, but I do understand that there's a lot more to do after getting out of high school art classes. Then I'm in Mrs. Pappas's physics class, who actually looks very similar to Mrs. Wallace, and I'm doing a powerpoint or web page presentation on everything from baseball to dreams. The strange thing is that I didn't think I finished the page, but somebody seemed to have finished it for me. Although it wasn't exactly finished very well, it looked like it was possibly enough to get by. I remember talking and talking, and realizing I'd only started talking about the first subject so I decided to briefly mention every other subject in the remaining minute or so I had left. I didn't realize my mother was there watching the presentation, who comments about it to Mrs. Pappas afterwards. Then, I'm talking to Mrs. Jones, another teacher. It's a one on one conversation but all the kids seem to be watching intently. I had a bag with me and told her I wanted to get rid of all my notebooks. She started telling me how good they were for ""easy reference"" and everything like that, and I mentioned they're not all my notebooks (and I'm not throwing all of mine away) someone else had just given me a notebook to throw away for them. Then she asked me why I'm always acting so serious. Then I see Mr. Pons (who always seems serious, but is always using his dry humor to joke about everything). He says something, so I then shout out ""Pon-SON!!!"". I make another joke and then look for my bag, which I find is gone. Mrs. Jones had apparently taken it down to the office or something to donate it to some organization, but I needed some of the stuff in that bag that was still important and I rushed to find her. I saw a school secretary smoking, and wondered why the school was considered smoke-free if she was allowed to do that.

I'm in a mall store, where there are a lot of girls who are lesbians, or at least talking about having sex with each other, and they're all girls I know in real life. I'm looking around, very interested in some of the things they are selling. I have a bag with a book or something in it, and Frank tells me to get going.

It's not really a map though, because I see people moving around and walking into the Prep Academy through it. I walk into a door, around where the library is supposed to be, and it turns into a kind of restaurant. I see it's very cheap, and I'm glad I found it: ""Soft drink and one free refill for 99 cents"". I wanna go down to the academy to see all the new juniors there, but I don't. There's this girl here who I ask, ""Do you wanna dance? I mean, skate is more like it!"" and we skate together all around the room, with our normal shoes on although it's like ice skating, and it's fun. Then her older sister comes around and starts saying something about either her or her sister's boyfriend and it sounds like she's complaining. When I leave the building, Chris Farley is standing in the doorway. My father is now there and quotes something from one of Chris's movies or comedy scripts, and Chris laughs. I ask if someone would mind taking my picture with Chris. Then I wake up, and realize he's dead.

"I'm possibly at Plainview High School, but I think I'm somewhere else, with friends from that school. There's a game we're participating in, possibly under Ponson's supervision, and the only person I remember being there is Eva. I remember being in this group and wanting to win. I also remember talking too much (not really too much maybe, just lots more than everybody else combined). I'm on a computer, in a building that looks a bit like a bar, on the QRS campus. Someone online (or maybe even ""physically,"" dream physically) lets me know she ""needs something"". I don't remember what it is, except that it's a file for her computer. I find a game installed on the UNIX server, and I realize what she wants would be in the game. Next, I'm in my cellar, except there are about 4 computer terminals along the wall with people at some of them. I see someone is online and gets off just as I log on. Now one of the computers is empty, and I see that the person (I'm not sure who it was) I wanted to talk to had literally ""left the room"". I'm disappointed. I think I'll try this again a little later. This time I see a girl sitting at a computer next to me. It's Kerry, and she looks beautiful. I put my arms around her and we dance. Then I want to go to my bedroom to ""make out,"" so we walk upstairs. I think the stairway is a little dark, but by the time we get to the top, she's turned into my brother, and I'm very disappointed. I want to fly out the window, but I don't want anyone to know I left. I see the air conditioner is in the wall and I don't want to make a loud noise taking it out. Also, something told me that even though I was dreaming someone might be able to tell I wasn't in my bed. I convinced myself that I was dreaming and my physical body would still be in my bed.

Eventually we file into this auditorium and I sit next to somebody, who asks to borrow my watch.

Eventually she turned into a beautiful cat or kitten. There are some empty seats on the bus right next to each other, so I want to talk to somebody else and sit with her, I just can't decide who that would be. I want to talk to Sara (who has actually moved away) about something that happened years ago, about which I don't have her side of the story, but I decide it wouldn't be that interesting to talk about it anyway. Suddenly I see Kerry and this alerts me that I'm dreaming. I think, ""Great, I can put this in my dream journal!"" I decide to leave the bus. I call, ""Hey, A."" and I tell the driver to stop. We get out. So, we're in what I probably think is France. I hug her and remember not wanting to let go. She disappears in my arms. Then, there's a building, possibly a museum. I remember parts of the building labeled ""castle"" for example, and there was also a gift shop. I went into the bathroom. For some reason that I can not fathom, Wayne Dyer was there telling me if I change the sign on the door, I can change where I am when I open the door. He changed it to a medical museum of some sort, and I came out to see an interesting display, although I didn't feel like reading what it was. Then I remember being outside, and finding out the police are looking for me and two others. I try to get away. I run in every direction (this was very weird, at first in this dream; I can't explain it) and then I just decide to keep running. I run through a fence door that was fortunately open, probably over yet another fence, then into the woods. I hear a guy yelling something in French I now recall sounded something like ""avez moi"" but I take it to mean, ""I'm armed."" I think this is another guy they're looking for, probably a burglar or murderer or something. I gladly run back to where I was to escape being killed, and by the time I get back outside the building the police are there. Someone tells me I ran a red light, and I'm only getting a fine. Then, I'm in a mall, walking through a book department and by some people I know. Then, I see Kerry #2 and we talk for a while, although I can't remember the conversation. The next thing I know he's having fun with my brother and he and my entire family are in the back seat of a vehicle. (?). Then, I'm in a car, someone gets out and there are a couple books on the passenger's seat: a book that looked like ""The Boy and the Girl"" and another. My CD's were probably in the car too, and I wanted to lock the car to prevent them from being stolen.

There is a very wide kitchen door that I try to close but the guinea pig gets out of the house. As soon as she sees the outside, she runs even faster across the street and keeps going. I run after her. I see her in the yard across the street but then she keeps running. She runs a little further into someone's backyard, where there are leaves all around. My grandmother is there, and I try to tell her to be careful where she walks because the guinea pig could be under the leaves. Then, all of a sudden my grandmother sits down on the ground, and says something which I don't remember. I think she might have stepped on the guinea pig, but it was right next to her. There's a puddle or small pond in the yard, and the guinea pig then swims through it. I manage to pick her up while she's in the water.

There is a big room, like a large college lecture hall with green seats, and I guess it is the room where we hold our junior class meetings. Mr. Ramey, my class advisor at Plainview, is there. There was a meeting about how to change the way classes are run. Some people, such as Riley, were throwing out ideas, but they weren't that great. I was disappointed this meeting had caught me by surprise, because I could have come up with much better ideas. Unfortunately, I felt incompetent to speak at this point. I knew I had some good ideas but didn't feel I could get them out in words without first organizing my thoughts. At the meeting, I talked to a girl for a few minutes, who leaves the room as soon as the meeting is over. She says something before she leaves, and leaves some of her stuff lying on a desk. I read one of the papers that is left, and it appeared to be a note to me, inviting me to call her sometime. Apparently she had forgotten to give it to me. She'd left, and I wasn't sure if she really forgot, or what was going on. I don't think I took the paper though. Then I'm definitely at Plainview looking for my class. I need to know what period is going on, but I can't find the office to ask anyone. The office seems to have moved, and I find something that looks like the office, but couldn't be sure it really was. The lady says that the school rules have changed, and another lady says they've been in the process of changing ever since before I was born (she seemed proud of the fact). She tells me I can go to whatever class I want to, and don't have to be limited to any scheduled class, because that's the new rule. I think maybe one of the ladies offers me ice cream. All of a sudden I'm munching on some vanilla (maybe some chocolate in it, too) ice cream. Not in a cone, or cup, just melting all over my hands. I see Christina Ricci there. I offered her some hand melting ice cream, thinking she probably wouldn't accept the melting stuff, and I was surprised to see she did.

I can't believe this, and for some reason it actually feels strange, and eerie, that I had seen her not too long ago. I think it was a car accident.

He pretends not to hear and when she calls again he runs like 5 feet away and then looks back to listen to her. I'm not sure what she said but I don't think it was about my toast! I don't remember what happened then, except that I went down to the bottom of the street to catch a ride to school from some seniors from last year- I remember Wesley and others. The car looks like a convertible, and we're driving down the street. All of a sudden, I remember thinking, ""We've been driving here a while. I thought in dreams, scenes changed often and people were always actively doing something."" I wasn't really lucid, but I wasn't aware of the time we'd been driving down the road until I sort of realized I was in a dream. If that wasn't enough to make me lucid, I then thought, ""It's the middle of summer! School's not starting yet,"" and I became a bit more lucid at that point. There was a cute blonde girl in the back seat, who I called over to the front (I don't even know if I said anything. I could have just motioned, or maybe just thought about it). I had her put her legs on my lap.

"I am at Plainview High School cafeteria, and one of the Spanish teachers asks for her ""sal"" (salt) in Spanish. I want to order in Spanish something that looks like chicken (later I find out it's bread), but for some reason Spanish just seems too familiar to me, and I can't resist the urge to try ordering in French, ""Je vais avoir de poulet."" Of course I don't know if the lady there speaks French. Instead, upon closer look, I see that the ""chicken"" is really bread. Then, I ask the lady what the pocketed sandwich is and she says it's spaghetti. I pay the lady although I don't remember if I got much more than a drink and sit with Mark?, Josh and others. I put my can of soda on the table and Josh slides it off the side. It's all over the floor. We're about to leave the cafeteria and the superintendent is standing there. We think we're in trouble but nothing really happened. We turned around (I don't know if he said anything to us) but we're soon in this part of the school I've never seen, nice booths and tables, restaurant style. These facilities are not being used, and all the students are made to use the lousy cafeteria. Now we see two boys, who were in trouble for some other reason, and they are told to clean up the spill. I see my school guidance counselor. Then I'm on something like a waterslide. I don't know how I got there, but when I get down I ask how I get back. Somebody tells me to climb back up the slide. I start climbing up, but then there's this really steep part of the slide that I reach (where, according to common sense, somebody might fly down at 100 miles per hour and kill me, and I probably wouldn't be able to get up it anyway). So, I just slide down the part I climbed. It wasn't that I really had to get back to where I was. Then, I remember a character who looked like a bit of a cross between Gail (female) and Mike (male) but it was a female. She asked the question, ""If I held your hand for 15 seconds, would you go out with me if I asked?"" Nobody raised their hand. I was going to but didn't. I think she was trying to convey that it's easier to say yes to something like that when you're holding the person's hand.

"I remember seeing Rachelca and telling her, ""You're the first girl I ever kissed in a dream,"" (and she was). This was somewhere in the middle of a seemingly extraordinary long dream sequence. I knew perfectly well that I was dreaming, but I don't think my conscious mind ever became active enough so that I actually become lucid. I remember being in the dream and thinking, ""This is a long dream!"" I don't remember how long it seemed to last, but I can guess at the time it seemed like hours. I was glad I wasn't waking up, that's all I can say. I remember getting to this classroom where a teacher (who I thought was a substitute teacher) called me such things as the ""textbook man"" and had me put textbooks on every desk. I had eaten before in the dream, and I recall it getting close to time to eat another meal. So, I was a little upset that I might miss my meal time by passing out textbooks. Riley was there, I remember. There were candies on a table- they were caramel, about 75 or 100 of them, and I took them all. Then realizing I'd never eat them all, I put about half back on the table.

"I remember another long period of dreaming. First I ask someone for a cigarette, although I don't smoke. Then I am in a car and my grandfather is driving, I believe to McDonalds. He keeps changing lanes and into places that aren't really lanes. Then we're on a bridge with water on both sides and I'm scared the car might go into the water. We get to McDonalds and asks me if, ""we need to get ketchup and mushrooms?"" (mushrooms, not mustard). I didn't pick up that half-rhyme until I woke up. But then, I'm in McDonalds and he expects me to order for him (I suppose he's in the car waiting). I don't have any idea what he wants.

"Mrs. Pappas is saying that we have a physics test around July 5, and I find out it's a summer reading test (also, I feel I will be on vacation during this time). I am talking to Jamie, or someone who resembles her, but she still looks a bit different than usual. It's a book whose name resembles ""Gideon's Trumpet"" which is an actual book. So I make the observation that we should read that book first. Jamie tells me the book is excellent. Kate is behind me, waving and flirting but I realize it could be a trick (as soon as I walk over there she'll disappear or get smaller or something) and I'd rather keep talking to Jamie anyway, and I have another one of those thoughts about how long the dream has been going on without actually becoming consciously aware I have been dreaming. I am aware the conversation has been going on for quite a while, and we seem to get very close to each other by the time it's over. I realize even the teachers probably notice this ""bonding"" going on.

"I'm in my grandfather's house. The police are looking for me for something I did (this whole part of the dream, for some reason, seemed like we were in ancient Rome but it was still my grandfather's house). The police find somebody else who seems to be a friend and take him in for questioning. I see this happening and think, ""Wait, maybe they think I'm Carbon"" (I could have also said ""Carton""). We are all sad that my friend is being taken in, apparently for felony drug charges. I realize I might not see him in a long time. I take him to be living on Main St. in Plainview (who he is I still don't remember), but he can't even remember the town he lives in. I decide, since I'm not in any trouble, that I will leave the house. My mother asks where I'm going, and says I have to be back before dark for some reason (it was already getting pretty late). I say I'm going out for a walk and that I'll try to be home before dark. I see some people, like Carla and Eva (I don't nearly remember everybody) running. I try to catch up to them, but they're always just a little bit ahead of me. I finally catch up. I think I sort of hug Carla briefly in a fun kind of way and say something to her and she asks what I said. I tell her, ""Never mind"" because we're now all too busy throwing around and running with a bunch of balls. Sam catches up, he has a ball, and I kick it. I understand that he doesn't want me to touch his ball. Soon we're at this kiosk, maybe at a flea market. There's a white-haired guy selling a bunch of post cards, bookmarks, or something like that. The prices are all in French francs. I pull out my wallet and he asks, ""Hey, is that one of those old peseta's? I really want one of those"" I look at it and it says 100 pesetas, but I'm not sure it was that old. I'm about to give it to him, but then he offers me three of his ""postcards"" or whatever they are, with a picture of a certain kind of bird on the front- in exchange for the 100 pesetas. I accept, although I don't really want what he's trying to sell me. I then look to see if he's ripped me off by trading in another currency but I realize the amount I spent in pesetas seemed about equivalent to the listed price in francs.

"I am taking a physics class at Plainview High School. I get one of the worst grades in the class, on two assignments. I feel that some of the questions were just dumb true/false questions. I wanted to go down to the guidance office and demand an independent study of the subject. At first I thought the usual physics teacher was teaching, but then I find out it was an eccentric man who we called Mike. He was rather weird, and funny. I can't think of any specific humorous comments he made or the things he did.

"I am in a hotel room with a lot of beds. I find out the cast of Saved By the Bell is sleeping there, and somebody tells me not to sleep on those beds. Then, I thought I heard a TV character coming to tell me I was on his bed. I never saw him, but I assumed it was him. I saw two girls I know on the first two beds on the left. Each of them had a cat who seemed like he'd sleep right by her side the whole night. I saw my grandfather's cat, Doc, except I think it might be Laura's cat. Somebody had turned music up to blaring levels. I felt bad for Doc for having to put up with such loud noise. Then three adults in the room started smoking. (I saw Miss Mitchell there too, but she didn't seem to mind). I tried to get away from the smoke, and I wanted to tell Mr. Dell (I assumed it was another school trip, I suppose) that I can't stand the smoke and ask if I could sleep somewhere else.

"I was in a car with my mother up near the Plantageants' house. There was some kind of problem with the car, and I could hear a noise that wasn't quite normal. The wife was driving, and told me to turn the key in the ignition backward and that should fix the problem. Then, probably not as a direct result of turning the key, the car went flying off the side of the road (staying on its wheels and managing not to hit anything), coming very close to driving into a pond. This next scene seems like it took place in about the same place. I think I have built a saddle for my pony, and I need help, maybe getting the saddle on. I'm in somebody's yard, apparently someone who has a lot of horses and animals of their own. The owners are a Ukrainian woman and her husband, as I soon learn. She doesn't want to come and look at my pony to answer the question. She says to me, ""If you consider selling it to me, I'll have to come and look at it,"" so I told her I would consider it. The next thing I remember, I am in the woman's house with a guinea pig. She tells me that people in certain parts of the world eat guinea pigs. She said that with such calmness and matter-of-factness I supposed she wouldn't be one to blink her eyes if she saw someone trying to put a poor animal on the frying pan. Actually, I wouldn't really have been surprised if guinea pig was her favorite meal. I obviously didn't let her get close to my pig.

"We are in another state. I remember staying with my paternal grandparents for the night. I was very cold there lying in bed next to my grandfather, and there seemed to be very few bed sheets. (Then, I remember some sort of ""educational program"" which didn't make sense to me after waking up). I got out of bed, and I remember standing there in the dark, very tired, and wondering if I'd begin to have hallucinations. I got back to bed, and my grandfather was pushed right along the edge of the bed. I asked him to push over and at last I had plenty of room to sleep. I am outside at a friend's birthday party playing volleyball. I have only socks on my feet, and see other people wearing the same. Everybody else has racquets to play volleyball with, but I don't. I go over some sort of tent or pavilion, and I see Paul. Someone asks him if Paul has known him for more than 2 years. Now I think it's his birthday, but it wasn't his party when this dream started. I am still under a tent, but now I realize there are all girls there. I didn't think I belonged there (not that I would be kicked out). I realized this when a coach started discussing the playing schedule of his volleyball or soccer team. I find myself in the kitchen of a restaurant, that seems to be in the general location of the party. I think the place was named after a fictional character. I didn't think I was supposed to be here either (I went the wrong way on the stairs and found myself in the kitchen) but some girl who works there didn't even notice as she was walking behind me. She said a few words out loud now and then but it seemed as if she was talking to herself. I could, however, telepathically catch the rest of her thoughts.

There is a drink on her desk, with a piece of liquorice in it for the straw. Rick asked if I liked to drink (alcohol), either that or the topic somehow came up. I kept dancing and saying I wanna learn how to dance. I saw Audrey talking to Joey and I was going to ask her if she wanted to go to a dance with me. By the time I'd asked, I thought she was Shannon who ignored me and left the room. I left to catch her (worried about leaving class and getting in trouble). I asked her again, wondering if she hadn't heard me. By this time she was yet another girl, Alison. I told her she could have at least said ""no"" but she waved bye and kept walking. I realized I didn't want to go to class (and it wouldn't matter anyway because it was a dream) so I didn't. I saw Beth and said, ""Hey Kerry! Hey, Ker!"" I was going to ask her to dance, but she dematerialized as she walked through the glass of an award case and disappeared. Then I asked this boy to dance. He said yes, and we were dancing ok but I said, ""This isn't what I want,"" and so I asked Louise who also agreed to dance. Then I remember knowing the bell was going to ring. I intuitively felt that when the bell rings, I'd probably wake up, so I tried as hard as I could to stay in the dream after the bell rang, and I managed not to wake up. Then I saw Mrs. Saint again. She didn't seem to remember me leaving class. I told her I hadn't realized the pun Rick had used before (asking about alcohol when there was ""liquor""ice on her desk). Some people were leaving the school building by now but others were staying around and moving out rather slowly. It sort of looked like a mall now that I think about it.

It was actually a dream about a prophetic dream, because I thought I had dreamed about the precise name of the school and it was now coming true. I walk by Rachel and her friend. I was going to tell her about my dream, but decided to just walk by her and pretend I didn't see her. Next, I remember being at the Academy. I have both electronics and chemistry projects due the next day. I had my projects lying on a table, which included a few chess pieces, and Noah threw it all away. I was extremely upset. Apparently, we had been told to throw away everything that was left on the table, but Noah was taking it to the limit. I didn't dig it out of the trash. I went and told Mr. Rosetti about my problem instead. He started talking about the project being due on Friday (it was Thursday) and it was as if he didn't hear anything I told him. I am now in a large room where I see a boy. I ask if he's a junior (since I've never seen him before) and he says he is. He has a bit of facial deformation and tells me he has a disease I can't pronounce. I asked him what it was, but I can't remember his answer. I just said ""oh,"" because I couldn't think of anything else to say at that point. I also talked to a girl (I know her name but forgot it. Then later in the dream I tried to recall it again and the first name to come to me was ""Samantha."") There is a doorway that opens slightly, and inside I find a spoon, which I take. There is some writing on the walls, which I write down hoping to be able to take it back with me when I wake up. Some gang members arrive (I can't remember if this was before or after finding the spoon). I try to ward them off with the spoon. They are carrying guns, and I take a guy's hand and aim the gun the other way while the trigger goes off, making sure they don't harm anyone. In the end, I think I take their gun, or they manage to lose it somehow. We are outside in the dark. Samantha is talking to one of the gang members and is about to walk away with him. I call her, ""Samantha, I really like you!"" and sort of pleaded, trying to stop her from going. She came over to me and we hugged each other.

She recited a line from the movie Reality Bites (we had watched it a couple of nights ago) and then we kissed.

"It seemed like four dreams combined into one. One was I was driving someone's car to somewhere and I never got there. It took forever so I think I was going to go to sleep. Then the next one was I was at a concert and I remember some strange guy in a mask and buying souvenirs from him later (I can't remember much of that one). Next I was at my house but it wasn't mine, it was someone else's but we were living there and I was with someone but I can't remember. Next I was at work and when I got done the same person from the last part was driving my mom's car and my mom was in the passenger's seat. They don't know each other, I remembered, so I'm not sure why they were together.

So I was going to sing for her but I didn't know a whole song (I just knew parts of it). At the end Alicia came for real so I didn't have to sing any more for her, but I wanted to.

"I was with someone driving in a dark parking lot. Everything was in full color. We were in a high-speed chase. It felt like some sort of action movie. We jumped from balcony to balcony, we ran, and at one point we ran right past the cops that were also chasing these criminals. It was like a never-ending chase. Sometimes we would get back into the car and cruise in the parking lot, making sharp turns and going up and down parking ramps. I couldn't see who we were chasing though. It was exciting. The setting felt like a huge shopping center, at night.

We are close to a hot fluorescent light fixture. We limbo under it. In a new school I say I don't know where to go, but surprisingly familiar. I go to my locker.

It felt like a spring day, and I was on a beautiful well-built horse with a deep chest and strong fore and hind legs, wide back, and a smooth gait. It was a chestnut mare with a black mane and tail and a white star on a wide forehead. Birds were twittering, and I was flying at a full gallop, the thrill of the ride filling me and making me vigorous and full of life. I was happy and at peace.

I dreamed of old friends in California and new ones all together in one place - my age, mostly girls and people I was friends with. I was happy, completely happy. I was in gym class with my new gym teacher with old and new friends. We had to line up. I remember bright pink dice, the furry kind people hang on their car mirrors. I saw things from Minnesota and California. Then I had to go with this girl to the nurse's office and we got there by running on the beach. Along the way I kept finding pennies in the sand.

His office was a room outside, across from the stadium full of people. I told him to come out and he did and we fought. I kicked his ass. He fell down and everyone in the stadium went crazy because I beat him up. Then I cried really hard and my 6th grade principal heard me and I cried because I still wanted to run. And then he came over and said I was a good fighter and I should run more.

I was standing in my living room and I saw my cat Kally and a cat that looked exactly like her, so I ran to my room and grabbed the cat treats because Kally usually comes running when I shake the box. So I shook the box and Kally came running. I picked her up and said, ""Good kitty"" and Kally morphed into that devil guy. It wasn't Kally! I was so scared. The devil dude said, ""Am I a good kitty?"" Then he started laughing this devilish laugh. He told me the downstairs was on fire (we live in a duplex) and I had 5 minutes to get out. But I couldn't tell my mom there was a fire or else I would die. So I was looking for my cats cages and I couldn't find them. So I grabbed a box, threw them in there with some food and grabbed my photo album of all my friends back home. Then I told my mom to come outside with me and she said, ""No, I'm really tired."" And I said, ""Please, mom, please come outside, I have to show you something."" So she came and I told her to grab her purse. So she did. We were walking down the stairs and she said, ""Sierra, the house is on fire, Sierra, Sierra...."" and then I woke up and my mom was saying ""Sierra"" and waking me up.

It was something that could happen in real life, but probably wouldn't. We were all just hanging out and talking and one of the guys pulled me aside and started telling me how much he was attracted to me and how beautiful I was. I got embarrassed and turned away. Then he turned my face back and kissed me. It could happen but considering the guy in the dream it probably wouldn't.

My best friend was in the dream - and she was in search of her meaning in life. She was 16 in my dream, as she is now, and her father encouraged her to find this meaning.

Then he realized the only way to die was if the ""mother bird"" killed him. This bird was the queen of this place I think. So my friend was told by her dad that he only had 30 minutes left.

I couldn't believe Paul thought carebears was cool. Kelly was no longer in the dream from this point on, just Becca, Paul and me. Becca was telling me to be quiet because she was watching the movie and Paul was talking about how cool the bad guy was. The dream was not unpleasant at all but the dream was not pleasant either.

"I was at my cousin's house (she is a female and she is 14). She was having a birthday party for her little brother turning seven. Our family was there and all the teenagers were downstairs. It was getting hot so I went to the bathroom to wash my face. When  I came out my crush was there. He's also 16. We both sat down and talked. I was so happy. He was telling me jokes and I was laughing. I did realize that I was laughing; then I woke up feeling weird.

"I'm in our family's station wagon and it started driving down a hill towards a busy street and the brakes don't work and neither does the steering wheel. But just before I hit the busy street I reappeared in my house. I headed toward the kitchen which is down a hallway. As I leave a long dark mink-like animal came out from the other hallway that is perpendicular to the one I was in. I knew it was going to attack me but I also knew I needed to get to the kitchen. The creature leaped at me and bit my stomach and I died. Then I started floating away but I got caught against a clear ceiling sort of thing which kept me from floating away. Then I woke up. I felt odd but not really frightened. Just disturbed and rather puzzled and odd.

"I was in an unfamiliar convenience store with an adult male who was mentally challenged. We were in the section of the store where the beverages were kept. (The person I was with slightly reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's character in the film Rain Man.) The man took a bottle of coke and I took one also. I also took a pack of cigarettes. I went to the cashier who was a male, approximately 25 years old, and wearing a red shirt. I placed the items on the counter and then took a cigarette lighter from a box full of lighters nearby. The cashier started the process of scanning the items to total up their price. I was nervous because I was under 18 and trying to buy cigarettes but he didn't demand to see ID. As I left the store, the mentally challenged man suddenly vanished from the dream and I became terrified that my parents would discover I had purchased cigarettes.

"My dream started off with me at my house and I was walking in front of my garage to the side of my house. I saw two snow tigers in my back yard. At first they didn't do anything, but then they started clawing at the fence. The fence had a nut and bolt and the more they scratched at it, the more it came unloose, but after about one minute they had broken free and came right at me. The bigger one grabbed my left arm, the other my right. I remember sensing another one but it wasn't around. I broke my left arm free and punched the tiger, and as soon as it happened, I felt I was dead and my next dream started.

By 3-inch, she means 3 steel shot about twice the size of a BB and one about the same size as a BB.  We then go into the woods to hunt.  The woods in Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's vacant lot in River City, I am pretty sure.  The first thing we see is a rabbit.  I lower my sights and track him.  Grandma keeps saying ""Shoot.  Shoot."", but he runs between us and a house.  I think the shot has rolled out of the gun barrel, but I am afraid to look down the barrel and see.  As we come to sort of a cliff, Grandma finally looks down it, and I was right.  We go back to the house and pick out more 3-inch shot.

There are also numerous obstacles such as shooting around a corner when you come out of the first two wickets.  Once, when my turn comes, I see my ball lying within about one foot of another ball, but as I draw closer, I see that it is quite a bit farther.  I hit it, however, and upon taking mallet's length to take two shots, I must lie through a doorway or a wicket or the like.  This means I will have to swing almost parallel with this object in order to strike my ball cleanly and at the same time miss the corner of the object.  I shoot at another ball, about 25 yards away.  With the first shot, I miss the ball at which I am aiming by several inches.

"Doug and I go to see The Thing, but shown by a home projector, not at a movie theater.  A lot of kids are there, including one girl I especially notice.  She is real cute and has long, sandy hair.  When the monster comes on the screen, I hide my face so that I won't have bad dreams.  The next day, I believe, I meet this girl on the bus (in my hometown), and we get better acquainted.  She seems to like me, and lets me put my arm around her.  When we get off the bus, I hold her hand on the way to her house, which seems to be on Newton or Richmond or Sandusky.  At this point, she seems to be Phyllis Rogers.  She asks me if I want to kiss her.  I look up the street to see if anyone is around, and then I kiss her.  We go up to the house, and I remember I don't even know her name.  At this point she seems to be Emily Koch, although she looks nothing like her.  I take out my address book and sit down in front of the house.  She says her name is Emily Myron, and her phone number is (something like) J1-01J11.  Just as I am starting to write it down, her father comes to the door, a small, slightly rotund man.  I stand up.  He says, in a rather brusque way, ""Don't sit on my flower bed again.""  I say, ""Yes, sir, but I don't think I was.""  But I look around and sure enough there is an impression in the dirt, which I touch to make sure it is real.

"I am with Patty, Doug, Jimmy Creagar and Jimmy Duggan, and possibly others, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  We go through some sort of house-type museum.  There is a lady upstairs who doesn't seem to like me, and when we come downstairs I look up just in time to see two metal ornaments which she has dropped from the second floor landing rushing down at me.  I catch one, and the other crashes to the floor.  With this delay, I am the last one out of the museum.  When I get to the car, a station wagon with Mrs. Witherstone driving, kids are piled up in the back seat almost as high as the ceiling.  Mrs. Witherstone, however, is the only person in the front.  I figure there must be some reason for this, so I tell her I will ride on top of the car.  I sprawl out on my stomach on top of the car, but as she accelerates, I start sliding off, so I jump off before we get moving too fast and run alongside the car, keeping up quite easily.  Next, we are downtown shopping and we come upon two ""pee-pee stations"" side by side jutting out onto the sidewalk.  The front wall of these was made of almost clear plastic-sort of milky translucent but not completely transparent; nevertheless, you could see through.  Jimmy Creagar went into one, and Patty into the other.  Doug and Jimmy Duggan watched intently from outside.  I needed to go too but had no intention of making a show of myself.

"I am at a baseball game, wearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt.  I'm not playing in the game.  Whoever our catcher is (short and blond), he sure can fire a peg to second base.  I happened to notice that our third base coach looks remarkably like Grandpa, and I comment on this to the boy beside me.  I look at the coach's leg, and sure enough he has a wooden leg.  There are runners on first and third, and on the next pitch our catcher steps across the plate as if to throw to second.  We all think it is just a bluff.  But then, seeing the runner decide not to go to second, he makes a weak throw to first, which doesn't get there.  The runner coming in from third stops about 3 feet from home and watches the ball bounce a ways past the first baseman and doesn't continue until it is retrieved.  When it is, the first baseman's throw to the plate is high.  I make an instinctive lunge for it, but stop.

I tell him I would love to, but that I am afraid I will do something wrong.  So he asks me if I want some breakfast, and I say yes, so he fixes me some.

This keeps up until I finally pick one up and start singing the first part of ""Come Go With Me.""  When Eddie Fisher does come out, he is introduced to a lot of people, and Ronnie introduces him to me, but he doesn't seem to hear.

I ask the man why I can't hit into left field lefthanded as well as I can hit into right field righthanded.  He says it's because I don't snap my wrists enough lefthanded.  Pretty soon I go into the church where the meeting is being held, and just after I sit down, a cute blonde girl comes in from the Chi Rho section and sits down by me.

I inquire around and find out that they have taken a rusty old piece of metal that they call a gun and the army is looking for them and will shoot them on sight.  Suddenly everything becomes a small town-kind of resembling my hometown but with very narrow streets about 15 feet wide.  It is Sunday, and church and Sunday School are just beginning all over town.

Daddy is there, in the first door to the left.  I tell him to give me the gun.  All it is is a round piece of rusty metal.  He gives it to me.  I step out of the door and hurl it toward the oncoming group of men, thinking they will take it and leave us alone.  But they keep coming.  I come back just inside the door, and when the first person opens it I lunge at him and grapple with him.

I think Daddy came down to get us, and we went through the doors of a department store on the corner nearby.  In one part of the building was a parking lot.  There I found our car, terribly bashed in from the rear, and the motor in the floor of the front seat.  I went and got Sharon, but she could hardly bear to look at it.  Then Daddy more or less put the blame on me.  He decided it would cost more than it was worth to have it fixed, so he bought a new one-a Chevy, I believe.  We were looking at it on some kind of clay or sand flat when I saw a huge red, hairy elephant.  It must have been 50 feet tall, with huge long legs and a long trunk.  I remarked to Daddy, isn't that a huge elephant?  He said they were all that big.  Then the elephant started toward Daddy, who had some peanuts.  As it was about to get Daddy, he threw the peanuts to me.  The elephant came after me and soon was sucking my hand into his trunk.   (The peanuts were in the other hand.)  I would pull away and run, but the elephant could overtake my 20 steps in about one.  I saw I couldn't run away, and was afraid he would trample me, so I threw the peanuts at him and continued running.   Sometime later, Daddy and I and possibly Sharon were sitting in a garage.  Daddy said, in a nice way, ""You still haven't admitted you're not a very good driver for what you let happen to the car.""  I almost burst into tears.  (When we found the car wrecked, the windows were up and uncracked, and the doors were locked.  Daddy thought I forgot to lock it and the thief locked it after abandoning it.)

This time there is no railing, and we go off into the river, which is only about a foot or so below the level of the bridge.  I kick off my shoes and socks and tread water until I can reach the bridge and hang on.  Everyone else gets out of the car, too, and the car sinks to the bottom.  While I hang on the edge of the bridge, a reporter comes up, kneels down, and begins asking questions.  He also asks about my hitting a girl named Denise with the car and killing her.  This makes me very mad, and I deny it vehemently because it seems I have heard this accusation repeatedly in this dream.

"This dream has the atmosphere of foreign intrigue.  I meet some girl at a beach, not Bayview Beach, though.  We get along pretty well, but I then I see her smoking, with some older bald-headed man.  It turns out that they are spies, or criminals, or something.  We know that they have taken a cab.  I ask Daddy if it was a Yellow Cab, or what kind it was.  He says it was just a plain drab colored kind of cab.  He, Jimmy Duggan, some other people, and I station ourselves at various points in the city, and feel almost sure of finding them.  Frustratingly, I have a lot of trouble seeing-everything is fuzzy or cloudy.  Finally we go home and wait for something to turn up.  I look at a rack of my clothes and wonder what to put on.  I don't want to wear the same blue shirt with the black squares.  I catch sight of a really pretty blue one that I have forgotten about having.  I look closer and it is two notebook paper wrappers with the name of my hometown newspaper written on them.  Inside each is a small pad of blank paper.

"Daddy, Jimmy Duggan, someone else, and I are coming home from somewhere, at night.  Daddy tells me I can drive Jimmy's car and he will drive the other one, which is a bronze-colored Ford, about a '53 or '54 model, but very shiny and pretty, with a lot of chrome, including one very wide strip along the side.  I ask him if I might drive this one, and he says yes.  I then ask him if we aren't stealing this car.  He says no, it belongs to a friend of ours who doesn't mind our driving it.  It has a semi-automatic transmission.  The clutch is also bronze and chrome and very pretty, with an odd shape like a shield or something, and letters that say ""For use only in reverse.""  Jimmy rides with me.  Pretty soon we are successful in picking up about 4 girls.  I tickle the back of the one in the front.  She likes it, so I tickle her stomach.  But Jimmy, who is now Joe Duggan, doesn't go for that.

"I am with a circle of kids in a clearing.  It seems like church camp, or at least kids from camp.  There are lots of pretty girls.  It is very hazy or foggy.  The kids are throwing a red ball a little smaller than a baseball into the air and letting it bounce on their heads.  Each time, it bounces straight up almost as high as it came from.  No one seems to be able to catch it.  I am sure I can, but I can't see clearly when I look up.  I finally track its general direction and get close enough for it to hit my hand on the bounce upward.

"Doug and I are in the boys' dressing room at a swimming pool.  There is water up to within about 2 feet from the ceiling, but we can stand on the floor and see each other as clearly, if not more so, than we could above water.  Paul Sparkles is there, and he makes this observation while I am still thinking about it.  What's more, pretty soon I find I can breathe in it also.  When we swim out the door, which leads right into the pool, there are two or three girls zooming around on an inflated raft which travels like a motorboat.  One grabs Doug by the hand (he was the first one out of the door) and starts towing him behind the raft.  He tries to get loose, but I see that she is real cute, and I urge him not to let go.  I cut across the corners they turn, swimming underwater, and attempt to come up under the raft and capsize it.   On the second such attempt they see me and stop.  Doug is no longer with them.  I recognize one of the girls as Linda something, and I verify my identification by asking her if she knows Carl something, and she remembers me.  She is pretty affectionate and looks just like Sandie Evans.

"I go to a concert or some other event in the car with Sharon.  I also take Ronnie Nadner and someone else.  I figure Ronnie will ride back with someone else, but when we go back to the car, he comes along.  We are supposed to go to CYF (Christian Youth Fellowship) that night.  It seems like Ronnie is going to that too.  Anyway, driving back, we are passing through some clean, green hills.  The highway doesn't wind around the hills like a regular highway but back and forth with switchbacks, and so we can see most of it most of the time.  Sharon says she had better go to her brother or her sister's house.  I don't like this, because I have planned on taking her all the way home.  I also feel kind of funny to find out that she has a brother and a sister.  She seems to be surprised that I didn't know it.   Pretty soon Ronnie asks me if I am not taking her home.  I tell him I have to take her to her sister's house.  Then they both say that she has changed her mind and was going home, and that she had said so about 15 minutes earlier.  The gas tank registers empty.  Sharon is either driving or backseat driving.  We pass up several filling stations and go to one that is kind of out of the way.  I buy $1 worth of gas.

"I have just gotten out of the car at the top of a long terrace, rather like the one in front of the Stermes' house in River City, only not quite as steep.  There is a river or stream or something at the foot of it, with a group of 8-10 people sitting at its edge and others milling around but rather scattered out.  Tyrone Bevels is at the top of the terrace, and as I pass him he throws a firecracker into the midst of the crowd of people and it goes off.  I turn around and lunge at him.  As we grapple, he says he meant to just throw it near them, but I feel that even that was a smart-aleck trick that could have hurt someone, and it doesn't appease me any.  Suddenly he lifts me in the air and throws me toward the river.  I feel the sensation of flying.  I don't know whether to land in the water and get wet, or on land and possibly get hurt.  I figure I will be humiliated, but I land in the water's edge and clamber back up the bank toward him.  This time, after a short scuffle, I have him high over my head and am just about ready to throw him with all my might (I am surprised by his lightness), but he apologizes and begs to be put down, so I just toss him down at my feet, rather heavily.

We are commenting on the fact that it is now coed when a tall pretty girl standing near us says, ""That's the reason for all the disease.""  In the lobby are tables with cakes, pies, etc., just for students to help themselves to, apparently, so I do.  There are also elevators.  In the class I go to with Sharon there is a very strict woman teacher.  She says she is marking me tardy for saying something to the girl in front of me (which I didn't) and not helping her with something.  I don't know what to make of this.  After this class I get lost from Sharon and don't know what class to go to.  I have just started there that day and so has Sharon, but she seems to know where to go and I don't, and I feel very lost.  I try Phys Ed down in the basement.  The coach is a sort of thin, short, wiry man, with a face resembling Johnny Barrett.  He says all juniors (which I am) are required to play football, and it costs $50 each.  I get out of there.

"I am going to River City for a week.  It seems as though I am going to go on the plane and Uncle Joe is going to pay my way, which I don't feel right about.  But I am walking and have been walking for some time-roughly the distance from church down Marble, down Wistful to Harrison, and through City Park until about Malabe Park-though it seems farther.  It seems to be both approximately that route but also, at the same time, a dusty country road toward a big hill sort of like a road toward Jagged Mountain on Joe Duggan's paper route.  I suddenly realize that I am not taking any luggage and the only pair of shoes I am taking is my old tennis shoes.  I am hesitant at first about going back, but then I remember my job appointment (from the previous dream), so I turn back immediately.  On the way (on Wistful, I believe), I pass a little store with a little car I recognize in front of it.  I go inside, and Uncle Ben is in there buying something.  The roof isn't very high and slopes down below head level.  I am glad for the opportunity to get a ride back.  Technically, the car doesn't really look like Uncle Ben's, but it is very familiar, and I associate it with him.

This person tells another person who is parked along the side of the lot that there is a cigarette on the seat of Mr. Ronheiger's car with dope in it.  I am shocked at this.  I notice that the driver of each car looks terrible, like a drug addict.  I pass a policeman when I cross the street, but am afraid to say anything while within sight of the cars.  When I get to the apartment building where I live, there are police all around.  (There is a police station on the ground floor.)  I walk inside, contemplating whether to tell them, and someone tells me that Rocky Gorman wants to see me outside.  I out a side door and Rocky grabs me by the collar and warns me not to tell the police.  I tell him I only live there, but we start to fight.  I take a couple of blows but get the upper hand, and with two uppercuts to the face knock him out.  I then carry him up to my apartment.  By then he is coming to, and I try to talk him out of the drug habit, recalling that he has wanted to be a great orchestra leader and probably turned to dope because of his failure.  I put him down and give him instructions on how to get out.  When he gets down to the next floor, however, he seems to be Rover (our dog).  I can see him over the landing, and tell him to enter the open door of the elevator, which will automatically close and go to the next floor, where I will have him repeat the process.

My sister Nancy and another little girl were there.  There is a car mashed head on into the embankment, with a person it and another car nearby.  I know they have been drag racing, and I am very mad when I found out Nancy was in one of the cars while they were racing.  I put my hand on the windowsill of one of the cars and it has blood on it, which gets on my hand.  On the way back we pass a house about 40 feet off the street.  It is the Ottos' house, and I see Robinette Otto lying under the window.  We stop and find out that a magician had been showing his tricks, had wrapped a cord around Robinette's neck, the end of the cord had broken off and it was too short to unwrap, and she had choked to death.  I am very shocked, and I want to cry but can't for some reason.  When we get home, the Ottos' house is still near outs, and as I pass it I see Mr. & Mrs. Otto and Laurie.  I ask them if there is anything I can do, and Laurie says they would like to have some Scotch tape.  I go home and find we don't have any, so I am going to go to the drugstore but they change their mind.  I try to comfort Laurie, but none of them shows any emotion of any kind.

We ride the bus and are going to church.  On the way, a smart-aleck guy gets on who won't give the bus driver the 7-cent fare when he asks for it.  The bus driver drives on anyway.  He is a very short, mousy man with a tan leather jacket.  Later I notice that they are sitting together.  When Nancy and I and the bus driver get off at St. Bernard and Broad, the other guy leaves, and the bus driver is really glad.  He says the guy was going to kill him.  I have an urge to do something about it, but I don't.  At this same place, I discover that I am not wearing church clothes.  What's more, I realize it is Saturday.  I don't have any money.  I ask Nancy if she has any, and she says no-only 20 cents.  For some reason it seems that is not enough.  I don't remember how we get home.  It seems like there was some really dramatic action between the bus driver and the other guy.  When we get home, there is a long cardboard box like department stores use, and its lid is moving up and down very slightly.  Daddy says that some dog discovered that Grandma Clifford had been buried alive.  They dug her up, and she was still living.  The lid is her breathing.  I never do see her.

I open the card, and inside is several clippings and a full copy of my hometown newspaper.  One clipping has Uncle Ben's picture and part of a headline above it which reads ""Higgins Second Only to ....""  I wonder if they could be the second richest people in my hometown.  The clipping is an orange newspaper like the local newspaper late editions, and so is the whole newspaper, so I look through it to see if I can find the whole headline.

This made me very mad, because I could just feel all the power in my hands and the bat necessary to hit one far over the fence.   Once I swung hard and trickled a foul off to the left, off the handle of the bat, and noticed that the bat, a brown one, was broken.  I had a hard time choosing another one which felt as good in my hands.  I started to use one, but it was a fungo bat.  Another was too short.  Another one was pretty heavy.

At one end of the platform is a pole about the size of a good-sized flagpole.  It is the end of a long machine serving as a conveyor belt or something.  It looks just like the rear of a 1958 Cadillac but stretched out to about 40 feet long, with scallops and dips in the whole length of it.  The molds have scalloped edges too-sort of like a cornbread stick mold or a knife sharpener.  From a pulley atop the pole, an iron block is quickly lowered by a rope which I hold.  Each one falls into a mold and assumes that shape.  Once, I get up onto the platform to try to do something to one of the molds, but the person I am working with says my hand will look like one of the molds.  So I use a stick instead, and retreat back over the molds.  The footing is very tricky.  There are also some large black oil drums.  I'm not sure what the ""Cadillac"" thing is, but every once in a while one end rises way up and comes back down.  On the opposite side of the machine is a large tree, and beyond that is a little store.  You can't see the ""Cadillac"" from the back door of the store because of the tree.

However, the man was definitely my father, and the killing seems to have taken place four years earlier (as I found out later), when the boy was 14.  She told me to find him and kill him.  For this job I had a dagger with a 5- or 6-inch blade.  I watched for this boy mostly from the house, but ventured outside sometimes.  There was a sort of wooded area across from the house.  I felt sure that the killer was in the immediate vicinity, but I was still looking for a 14-year-old boy.  Pretty soon a fat gypsy came around the corner and told me he had seen a couple of boys running toward the woods.  I set out for the woods, wondering how I would go about such a task as killing a person.  I thought I would ask him first, ""Why did you kill my father?""  I felt the side of my leg to see if the dagger was still there, and it was.  When I got to the woods, I could see a few people at various distances, but realized that I didn't even know what this killer looked like.  Soon I came upon a clearing where the old woman and another woman stood.  They were just leaving, evidently from visiting a grave.  There was a garage nearby.  The old lady said to look through the crack in the door and I would look ""right at his nose; he's hanged himself.""  I reluctantly peered through the crack, and there, hanging by his feet, but definitely very much dead, was the purported killer, with his mouth slightly open in a sardonic grin, all his teeth showing.  He was about 18 years old.

I look frantically everywhere but can't find the record.  Somehow I get Sharon.  We were supposed to see South Pacific, but it is already about 9:30.  Then, either at the shop or at Jimmy Creagar's house-the former, I think-I find a man and a woman dead and each slumped across a chair.  They really look terrible:  their faces are gray and starting to rot-all the usual horror movie stuff.  I tell Sharon ""There's no use in us going to the show now.""  The time by now is about 10:00.

"Our family arrives at church, and I discover that I only have on a dirty pair of trousers and a sleeveless white t-shirt.  I wonder why Mother and Daddy didn't notice it before we left home.  I can't go to Sunday School and church like that.  Mother says I'll just have to go home and change.  I start out in the car, but notice that my good blue trousers, my suit coat, and my white short-sleeved dress shirt are in the car.  So I decide to find a closer place to change.  I go to Longhorse St. and am going down it in the direction of our house when I see a streetcar on the tracks with nobody in it.  It has doors like a train coach on each end, and is almost covered in ivy.  I consider it as a place to change, but think someone might come along, and the ends are kind of open.  I think on the way home I will go through City Park and possibly find a place there.  Then it occurs to me that possibly I will see Linda Forestt there, since she is supposed to be camping at 10:00, and church started at 9:45, which reminds me that I am already late.  I go through the entrance to City Park and see a bunch of girls swimming in a pool.  I am surprised-the weather isn't exactly cold, but it isn't warm either.  I go on to Aunt Wilma's house to change clothes.  I don't have a tie, so decide just to wear the slacks and white shirt.  When I get there, all the girls (Girl Scouts) are there. I think Linda is there too, but I'm not sure.  I realize that church is more than half over and when I get back it will be over completely.

"[In the dream, I have a sense of déjà vu, but in waking life I don't remember having dreamed it before.]  Some other people and I are riding down an incline on something like a ski lift--or an airplane, but not as high as an airplane.  Off to our left is a green meadow with several cathedrals, with various and beautiful architectural designs.  We are quite a bit higher than them, but can see all of each one.  Next, we are on a bus on the same incline, but on a highway heading down toward a river or a lake.  It looks like we will run right into it, but we turn on a highway running alongside it.  We aren't going very fast.  Next, we are on a dock.  Rev. Findley is flipping a quarter.  He misses it, and it falls into the water about 2-feet deep.  We can see it from the bank.  Jimmy Duggan says he will get it, but he doesn't.  I test the water, and it is lukewarm, so I go in.  I come out of the water dripping, but don't remember getting the coin.

"I am down the highway from a sort of drive-in restaurant or donut shop facing the highway.  A car stops in front of it and two men wearing black leather jackets get out.  I am suspicious, and sure enough, one shoves a gun in the window of the place.  I go around to the back and am going to call the police if I can find a phone.  A man comes around there and gives me a gun and says to keep them there until he gets the police.  To show me how to use it, he fires two of the three shots left.  I go around to the front, and they are just getting into their car, a brown and yellow 1957 Ford.  I talk to them a while and tell them not to leave.  Someone I know is in the car with them-not as a hostage, I don't believe.  The driver has a gun too, but I have the drop on him.  They say they are going to leave, so I take the barrel and swing it at the windshield, but the windshield doesn't break.  They pull away, and I forget to get their license number.  I go back to the restaurant, and a man is in front of it on the ground-shot, but not dead.

"I am at Grandpa's house.  Charles Wallers and I and someone else (Joe Duggan, I think) are in the front yard.  I look up in the sky on the Creagar's side and see a big, black cloud.  It forms into a black funnel-the first tornado cloud I have ever seen.  I start to run into the house, but can't get my legs to move very well.  I holler to the other two guys that a tornado is coming, but can't get much volume out of my voice.  They finally hear me, and Joe starts for the house.  Charles starts home and tries to get me to go with him, pulling me by the arm.  I keep telling him to let go-I don't know how soon it will before the tornado reaches us.  I finally get away and get to the house.  It gets pretty windy, but I don't think the funnel actually hits us.  Grandpa and I go outside, and there is just a wispy black cloud left floating over.  It is almost dark, and something hot and glowing drops onto the back of my hand, and another falls on the ground.  One is a sort of miniature jeweled dagger.  Both are 5 or 6 inches long.  By the fence in front is a saw with a yellow handle and some other tools.  I ask Grandpa if they are his, and he says no.  I can't figure it out at first, but then I remember how objects are picked up by tornados and deposited elsewhere.

"I was walking into Uncle Bill's boathouse, and Mother was there.  She said ""Shhh-you'll scare him away.""  She was trying to catch a fish.  When I looked down, I saw it turn and swim slowly away.  It was huge and black-about 2 or 3 feet long.  It swam right between the open jaws of an alligator, which did nothing.  As I walked along the edge around the inside of the boathouse, I saw that there were two or three great crabs in the water-all about 12-15 feet wide, not counting their long, wavy arms.  It was very unnerving.  I thought no one would believe me.  They were just like monsters in a horror movie.

Soon I came to a small town-the neatest, whitest little town I have ever seen-all along one little street and only a block or so long.  There were two soldiers in the street.  I went by very slowly, and they didn't move.  There were soldiers everywhere, I don't know why.  I went up to one white house and knocked.  As I waited, I looked around.  The town was surrounded by trees, and the sky could just be seen in patches.  It was a beautiful sight.  Ronald Dunnington came to the door.  I asked him why the soldiers were there, and he didn't know.  He also didn't know why the houses were so neat and white.  I rubbed my finger on the side of the house and got a white smudge, so I figured they must have been freshly painted.  Some girl was making up the bed in Ronald's room.

I looked out and saw a lot of people moving out of the barn and heading for the house-kind of backing up.  Someone was ordering them out of the barn,  I walked cautiously to the door and peered over the edge and saw just a glimpse of a reddish forehead.  I knew it was Clayton Thome, and that if I stuck my head out in sight he would shoot me, for he had a shotgun, and was looking up when I saw him.  I ducked back inside and told Jim.  Jim went to see for himself.  I was afraid he would get shot, but he didn't.  We started looking for a place to hide or escape, for we were sure Clayton was coming up.

Attached to it were four or five bloody hands, resembling dogs' paws.  I could hardly stand to be there.  Someone told me that if anyone had handled a paw originally (there had been only 2 originally), they might get the disease too, whatever it was.

Gail and Martha were cigarettes in a Pall Mall pack.  Martha punched Gail, but it seems like it was from the outside, because upon examining the pack, I found it to have a small dent in one side.  I opened the pack, and could see on the charred end of one cigarette.  I emptied the pack, and they were all ashes.  I was horrified.  The explanation seemed to be that Gail had gotten so mad at Martha that her anger had burned them both to ashes.  I wondered it if had burned Lillian too, but then I saw her coming.  She said she had been to get a hamburger.  I hadn't seen her leave, so I asked her if Gail had gone with her.  She said no.  Judy and I then sat down and cried all we could.

"There was a bridge or dock, like the pier at Lake Evergreen, but it had a sharp turn on a steep incline.  I wondered how cars kept from crashing through the rail and falling into the water.  A little girl was there, and her father kept telling her to go on home, but she wouldn't.  There was also a house, evidently beside this body of water.  There was a rope or vine hanging down to swing on.  I don't know how I did it, but I swung very high.  When I went above the top of the house, I saw that it was flat.  I thought I would let go and land on it, but I rose too high above it to let go.  I thought I would try it again next time.  On the way down, however, I decided to let go over the water.  I kept falling and falling-not slowly, but pretty fast, like going off a high diving board.  I wondered why I hadn't hit the water, but discovered I wasn't over the water at all.  I don't remember hitting the ground, but the next thing I realized was that I was inside the house kneeling beside a chair or divan with my head on it.  Daddy was occupied with something in the doorway of another room, but he was talking to me.  I wanted to try to make him think I was dead, but I would forget and open my eyes every once in a while.  I was afraid he had seen this, and so, since he kept asking me things, I figured I had better answer or he would get mad, so I did.

While walking from the garage to the house, I saw two girls in the Skinners' yard.  I wondered if I had anything on.  I found I had on a purple bathing suit and a light purple shirt.   Later in the evening I went up to the Skinners'.  They had two girls about my age, and one especially was pretty cute.  I didn't remember having met her, but she kept holding my hand, and they both seemed to like me.  They also had a couple of brothers, one of them about my age.  He shook hands with me as I left.  I thought it was strange that the girl was the second girlfriend I had had from this same house.  When I got back to our house (i.e., the Stermes'), it was pretty late, and there was a party going on.  When I came in I saw a lot of people-dancing, etc.  There was a jukebox with about the same selection of songs as the one at Hangout's on Madison Ave.  There was also a cigarette vending machine.  I saw one man I thought was Leon Witherstone.  When he saw me, he shook hands with me and joyfully said how glad he was to see me.

I asked if he had not been really dead but only in suspended animation or something.  She said no, the doctor had said he definitely was dead.  Then I could only believe it was a miracle.  I prayed to God and thanked Him for such a great thing, and I promised that I would always do right in return for it; but as I made the promise, I thought of an incident in which I had caressed Hillary's breasts, and I knew deep in my heart that, regardless of my gratitude, I would never be able to forego such pleasure.

There was a Walt Disney movie playing next door, and my sister Nancy wanted to see it, so she got in line there.  They were giving out clown suits, and Nancy wanted me to get one, so I did.  It was only a sort of wide, pyramid-shaped outfit with a hole through which to put your head, and a long, tall hat.  I went back to where Hillary was waiting in line for ""The Nun's Story"" with her family.  I noticed that Doug Dyer was there too, in another part of the line, with his family.

Even when I climbed up on a ledge, they could still just touch my feet.  I threw a small steel ball at one but missed.  I had a revolver in my hand, and there were some boxes of shells on a workbench, so I asked John Rayne to throw me a box.  He started rummaging through them but couldn't find the right ones.  Soon he and the bears went away, and I got down and advanced cautiously to the workbench, where I got some shells.  They were flat paper or cardboard with a hole through the middle and lined with cork on one side.  I then retreated to my former position but couldn't load the gun.  While I was there, a man came by in a car (a convertible) with the same kind of gun and demanded my money.  He said he knew I had $100, because he could see it sticking out of my pocket.  Actually it was only a $5.  I got down and went to the car and got about $30 out of my wallet.  But then I started asking him how he had fallen into this racket, etc., and kept him talking.  I asked him if he could show me how to load the gun, and he did.  Then I pointed the gun at him and told him to scram.  But he pointed his at me, and when I pulled my trigger the gun didn't fire.  He pointed out that I had the safety on.  Soon he seemed to be Martha Watson, and I still kept her talking.  After asking her what church she went to, I put my arms around her and kissed her.

Randy Creagar and his dad were there, and so was Judson Schinn.  I saw some fish swimming around and decided to go above and try to get a knife so that I could spear one.  However, when I started back, someone would not let me take the knife; they thought someone would get hurt.  However, I found one just as good below, and while I was hunting, someone told me Judson had already gotten a fish.  I got out again and climbed the rise along the railroad tracks along Acorn Pl.  He had the fish, a pretty nice-sized one, cut open and was cleaning it.  (Another note about the ""basement"": from the outside it was like an aquarium with the water and the people in it like an underground canal with a cutaway view.) I went back down the rise and some kids were sitting on a blanket and some newspapers.  One of the newspapers was open to the movies listings.  It seems that maybe Jody or Peggy were there, and some girl who was ""Charley's"" (Wallers, I believe) girlfriend-a rather young girl.  I don't remember whether Charley himself was there.

"I set out to carry a roll of papers to ""Professor Cross, 32 Cross St., Brookline."" I started not for Brookline apparently, but for South Boston. I came down to the wharves. My roll of paper developed into an iron cylinder and grew to enormous dimensions, say 8 feet in diameter and 100 feet long. Before it became unmanageable, I got it aboard a whaleback steamer and lashed it along the deck. I headed out into the harbor with my huge black pipe. I remember just how the black paint was roughened over the round-headed rivets. Off the New England docks a steamer came up with my craft. She was a beauty--the hull was made of natural wood, brown, oiled, and polished like an Adirondack shell. She must have been 30 feet long, had three masts and was schooner rigged. The stranger came near and someone looked down from her rail at my low-lying vessel and invited me to come aboard and go with them to Bath. ""No, I am bound for Winterport,"" I replied and added, indicating my deck load. ""This is a ventilating shaft."" I came into a class of a dozen men and two or three women. Mrs. R. ought to have been in charge, but it seemed to be Mrs. F. Ventilation and respiration seemed to be the matters under discussion. Presently we found that the class was to be subjected to an experiment on the effects of expired air. We were to be sealed up in a small room without openings for 12 hours. Our instructor spoke feelingly of the sacrifice we were to make. She showed us a gorgeous lithograph representing three men--heroes of a similar trial.

"At various times I seemed to be trying to reason out physiological questions -- with no success however. I have no idea why I suddenly found myself tossing in a canoe on a pale green sea, but this was my experience. The atmosphere was yellow and so were the sails of some large vessels, which scudded past. I remarked particularly that one was a hermaphrodite brig and one a barkentine. My canoe finally slid away of itself and I landed on our own stone wall -- Turner St. being a sort of Venetian canal. I was enclosing my favorite confection in frail little boxes (made of burdocks, I think) and packing these away tier on tier in a large drawer. I finished my work and went away, returning presently to find that the chocolate had all melted, the boxes had gone to pieces and the contents of the drawer were a mottled, semi-fluid mass. By and by my father appeared and talked about war relics. He especially lamented that he had not brought home any muscles. He said these souvenirs were very expensive, but one John Billings had a collection of fifty. There was a football game in Copley Square. I scored a touchdown for Tech by carrying the ball up the steps of the Public Library. Anon, a great band like Sousa's, was about to play. I held my breath for the opening crash, but instead the woodwind began to play sweetly and softly the tender chords of the accompaniment to ""Comfort ye my people."" About the third measure I woke up -- tried to go to sleep and hear more -- but the thread was broken.

"It seemed to be Sunday morning. My father had gone to church and I was about to go. I supposed the house was empty, but as I started downstairs, I saw a young girl -- homely and dressed in black -- cross the hall from one room to another. She resembled no one I can think of. I stood still in perplexity and my eye fell on her hat and veil lying on the table. I thought she must be going to church and that I should wait for her. So I waited. Shortly doors began to open all over the house and more strangers appeared. Three men came clattering down the attic. I thought they might have been sleeping there. They passed me with wonderful speed and left the house. Women and children also flocked by me. No one spoke. I went to church and found only four or five people there. M. E. W. K. -- sat by the middle aisle and I stopped to speak with him. Then I went on and found my father. I asked him if he knew our house was full of guests. He showed much annoyance and said he knew it and that they are ""an obnoxious, mercenary lot."" Forthwith they streamed into church and I was jammed up against the end of a pew as they crowded by. They did not look at me or speak. I remember especially one middle-aged woman, florid and portly, in a gray dress. The throng seemed endless.

"I stepped from an eastbound evening train at West Newton. An engine running rather slowly crashed into the rear end of the train as it stood at the station and derailed all the cars without upsetting or smashing them at all. One man had his leg jammed in some way and there must have been tons of pressure on it, but presently something shifted and set him free. He merely slid to the other end of his seat and sat still. I was much relieved to see that he was not hurt. Walking through the cars, which were very out of line, I was grasped by a little boy who was shrieking with nervous terror. I carried him into the station where he became quiet.

"Father and I reached Portland by rail and went immediately to the harbor front. Walking by the docks, we came to a gently sloping beach. Here I noticed that we both were wearing bathing suits. We waded into the water, which was deliciously warm and which seemed neither to resist us nor make us unstable. We walked fast and easily. The bottom shelved very gradually and it was only after some time that I was obliged to go on tiptoe to keep my head above the surface. It was a bright day and the bay was smooth. We passed some islands and I began to expect to meet the swell of the open sea. Presently my father said he would show me some superior tobacco and, sure enough, we shortly came into very clear water with a rock bottom overgrown with brown tufts resembling sea anemones, but really tobacco. I could smell it plainly, though my nose was still above the ripples. I wondered if my father would buy this singular and valuable farm. We left it and walked straight out toward the empty eastern horizon. I began to be scared. The water became a trifle deeper and I had to jump from the bottom to catch a breath of air. Then it shoaled again and we mounted a sandbar which exactly reached the surface -- so exactly that many little pebbles were half out of the water, but none entirely so. The seaward side of the bar was steep and with deadly fear I followed my father down the incline. ""This is the edge of the continental base,"" I thought. ""We shall go down for miles."" But I did not think of turning back.

"All I recollect of the first part of the night is that I walked repeatedly through a stone arched railway culvert. It was not the celebrated one at ""Ame Pratts."" Each time I went in below and crawled out by a vertical shaft on the other side of the track. The locality seemed to be above Westfield on the Albany. Toward morning I found myself reduced to about six inches tall and once more in an underground place. It was a cubical chamber about as big as a soap box. The walls were white and stuck over with cooked pieces of macaroni! Two circular tunnels slanted away toward the surface of the earth and through them a pinkish light streamed. I was in the burrow of a white rabbit that soon appeared. He seemed quite peaceable, but his comparatively enormous size made me uneasy. (He was, in fact, nearly two feet long.) I started out by one of the tunnels, walking backward. The rabbit followed, also backing. I pounded his flanks with my puny fists, but with no effect. Emerging from the hole, I suddenly regained my normal size, captured the rabbit and carried him off. (He was now brown.) I thought I must kill him for the laboratory, but I was very unwilling. Finally I tried to strangle him with one hand while with the other I felt his warm chest to note when his heart should stop beating. But my resolution failed and I let the poor animal revive. I carried him through Newtonville Square and came to a decaying colonial house.

Presently one of them ran down another, which instantly sank. Then the offender headed for the remaining craft and struck her similarly. She went down stern foremost. Her bow remained a little above water and pointing straight up for some seconds. I reasoned that she probably had an airtight space forward. I was in Roxbury with my brother. He asked me where Mount Pleasant was, but I directed him to go to Grove Hall and keep on for a mile beyond. We separated. I walked a long way thru a thickly settled section and came to a vacant corner lot upon which six or eight men, all resembling Mr. H., were camping out or picnicking. Without previous thought, I found myself inquiring about J.B. They said she was out of town. With remarkable inconsistency, I told them I knew it, adding (a lie) that I did not want to see her, but her mother. The last impression I have is a strong one of being altogether out of sorts with myself and everybody else.

A man collected the fees and then brought in a small shepherd dog and a half grown pig. We expected to see them perform, but something interrupted.

Here I found sections of the floor displaced and could look down upon a crude and ponderous pumping engine, which seemed to have wrought the mischief. At this point the L's appeared, both wearing beards of a very light color. I went with them to Lowell and we found ourselves in a street bounded by huge mills built of dark granite like the buildings at the Navy yard. A sign read -- Brig Square. The place was quite deserted although the sun was high and shone warmly. We went along to a residential part of the city and tried the door of a house in a handsome block. It was not locked. We went in and poked around the rooms, which were richly furnished. We explored every floor without meeting anyone. We did not take or injure anything. At last, as we came into the front hall again, we heard heavy foot falls on the stairs. We hurried to the door. Something made me walk unevenly, and looking down I saw I had lost an overshoe. Glancing back, I spied it on the parlor threshold and I promptly kicked my remaining rubber after it, thinking, however, that it might identify me. The steps sounded close behind as we rushed out and ran with all speed down the street.

I went on to discuss the formation of Boston Harbor and the headlands of Hull and Nahant.

"I looked from a car window into a land which, it seems to me, I have visited before when asleep, though never when awake. There were no trees. Jagged cliffs of gray limestone rose out of smooth and rolling fields covered with short, fine grass--mostly beautifully green and as free from weeds and stones as any lawn. Above the ledges the ground was again grassy and thrown into swells and hollows of most graceful contour. Then more cliffs sprang to another level and so on, terrace above terrace. Here and there smart white buildings stood out in the powerful sunshine. ""Peterboro Mountain,"" I announced confidently as I viewed my creation. Wandering over the green slopes, I approached a towering mass of rocks in which was an opening--a great funnel slanting down with a small glimmer of light at the end. Evidently it extended through to the other side of this rugged spur. I went in. Presently the passage tapered until I crawled, rubbing the rock and descending gradually. At length I could squeeze no further. A yard or two ahead I could see that the light which had guided me streamed into the cave from an invisible source--probably an opening--around a corner at the left. Suddenly I felt oppressed and dizzy. I climbed a rough ledge above a large and beautiful spring. There were pebbles of pink and slate color at the bottom of the clear pool. Mr. U. seemed to be up above among the bushes. I was on top of Mr. H.'s room, sitting close to the edge and dissecting some large moths, which I killed by rolling them in paper saturated in picric acid.

It pleased me very much. In fact, I seemed quite fond of her, though I did not know who she was and cannot identify her now. I think she wore a brown coat and I remember most vividly her tan colored glove with black stitching on the back.

I came to our house and seated myself on the piazza. By and by the C quartet seemed to have planned a sea trip. We were to take a train at 8:10. I reckoned that this would be an express and get us to the wharf by nine. Then I remembered it was winter. I fell in with L. near the old corner bookstore at night. We started toward the north end, but finding we were leaving all lights behind, we faced around and decided to go to a theater. I do not remember reaching one. Shortly it was day again. I came to the brow of a precipice and concluded to jump off. I was a little uncertain as to the result, but thought I could do it well enough. And so it proved. Clearing an iron railing, I sailed down easily to a jutting point thirty feet below, landed lightly and leaped off again. Three or four such stages placed me at the foot of the cliff.

"This dream must have taken me into the future for I found the present church much altered and I recognized very few of the people there.

I asked someone if this was for T. H.'s chorus. ""No,"" was the reply, ""They sing in a picture."" Probably this was a poetical way of saying that they had passed into history. The pulpit, I think, was gone. The greatest change was in the organ. The original part was still discoverable, but it had been extended across the entire front of the church. There were ranks of silver gray pipes rising before the chancel windows. Some were so long that they rested on the floor and disappeared through the roof. Smaller ones flanked the minister's room. At three places there were keyboards and benches. Mr. Y. was in his old position playing a stormy composition. When great power was demanded, he jerked a clothesline which swung open a large door in the case of the organ, and the tones pealed out with overpowering effect. Then the door would swing to with a slam.

The ice began to melt and trickle down. Channels formed in the mass, its angles were rounded away; the sculpturing went on rapidly.

I had no excuse for doubting that this was a genuine awakening. But to my distress and alarm, I found myself crouching in the middle of a strange corridor. It was not wholly dark. I could see that there opened from it three or four doors, one of which nearest me was ajar. The room was slightly lighter than the hallway, as though it were early morning. My mind was painfully clear. I was conscious of my nearsightedness, also that my bare feet were on cold matting. I knew I must have been walking in my sleep. It was a terrible discovery, and I argued against it eagerly that I had never been known to do such a thing before. But the stubborn circumstance of my position silenced me. From thinking how I could distrust myself and to what dangers I should be exposed, I passed suddenly to the awkwardness of my situation. Where was my room? The corridor did not seem to correspond to the one outside my door, but I might be mistaken. The open door might be mine and I must make some move. I would steal over there. Just at this point the scene faded out of my consciousness as gently as a dissolving view an the happy realization that my head was on a pillow and my body stretched in bed crept over me as a boundless relief.

It became more so as other men kept arriving, and I was crowded farther and farther from the centre. I was soon compelled to sit down. I dug my heels into a slight groove and rested partly on my palms, while I watched apprehensively two fellows--Hopkins students--who were in front of me and consequently on a steeper surface. The pressure behind forced me forward and the inevitable happened. The two men could no longer sustain themselves. Without a cry they began slipping with increasing speed until they shot over the cornice at the base of the dome and dropped into the depths, their dwindling forms revolving slowly as they fell. My horror was intense, and I saw no escape from a like fate. My heels were grating over the rusty iron plates when, happy thought!

Someone came to me with a book in which I was shown a series of pictures and diagrams in explanation of a strange repulsive game. It was to be played on a bowling alley. But instead of pins, living rabbits and guinea pigs were to be set up. How they could be kept quietly in their places and up on their haunches, I do not know, but this was demanded by the directions. The guinea pigs were to be set at the extreme and far end of the alley, a pair of them, and in front of each, about two feet nearer the bowler, was to be placed a rabbit. The usual massive balls were to be used. Now the object sought by the player with all possible science and skill was to send the balls down the alley, past the rabbits, and curving in beyond them to mash the helpless guinea pigs against the wall.

"I gave G. a pocket book containing several hundred dollars, and sent him out to secure a passage for Europe. He soon came back, giving me the balance of my money and my ticket, a very small one, enclosed in an envelope marked, reasonable enough, ""First Class, $80."" He also gave me a folder containing information regarding the line and its ships. These had odd short names of a Slavic form; I think one was ""Apski."" Suddenly I remembered I was married and must not leave my wife. I regretted my purchase and asking G. whether I could hope to sell my ticket to a scalper, I woke.

"I dreamed that I was in the room with my aunt, and suddenly discovered the neck of a bottle sticking out of my left side pocket. I hastily turned it way from her and went to the pantry, where I hid it. I knew it to be a certain wine, but I had resolved to tell her, if questioned, that it was raspberry shrub.

"Last night I thought I was in Georgia--Savannah, I suppose--and that I walked five miles or more into the country to a hamlet called Boulderville. Here I saw a sign, ""To the Spring,"" and going down a grassy lane, I found it beside a swift stream and near a railroad. It was a clear copious spring welling up from the center of a patch of clean gravel. I returned to Boulderville and spoke to a native of the fine flow of water. ""Enough to fill a six inch pipe,"" I said. ""Yes,"" he replied; ""a manufacturer from Chicago talks of piping it there. It would furnish one-thirteenth of the power needed for his factory.""

"I stepped from my train at Huntington Ave., leaving the wrong side of the platform and threading my way between the cars which had brought me and another train on the next track. The space was distressingly narrow. I was following a young fellow who was perhaps five yards ahead. The train on my right started slowly moving with us, then the car abreast of me became derailed and veered toward the other train, which was yet standing still. The two ground together with a hideous sound. The man before me was caught, and must have been instantly crushed, for the space where he stood closed utterly and the contact extended swiftly backward. I was in a narrowing crevice. ""Heavens,"" I said in agony,"" ""why doesn't the engineer stop?"" Then as a last resort, I dropped to the ground and let the bodies of the two cars jam above me.

All but the lowest in the right hand series showed an unmarked black surface, the last, however, bore in white letters the strange word ""zikery.""

"I came along Central Ave. and reached a house which seemed to be the one next Mr. B's. I noticed with surprise that some accident, perhaps an explosion, had occurred there. Windows and ornamental woodwork had been shattered. In a moment I was horror struck to see in the front room downstairs a young woman seated stiffly upright just within the window; her fixed, wide open eyes and expression of congealed terror convinced me she was dead. As I stood gazing at her, I became conscious of a movement upstairs, and, glancing up, I saw another woman walking about in the room directly over that containing the corpse. I made gestures to attract her, striving to have her understand that there was something amiss below, and shortly she hurried down and came out of the front door. As soon as she stepped upon the piazza, she turned toward the window which opened on it, then, catching sight of the dead, she started and fell in a faint. This was too much or my nerves and I woke in a tremble.

"I have never seen this celebrated house (the Fairbanks Mansion) at Dedham, though its picture is familiar enough. When I viewed it in my dream the only odd thing I noted was that the middle section of the long, rambling building was built of brick. Around the homestead stretched green fields in full sunshine. All was peaceful and quiet excepting that across the road a barn was burning with more smoke than flame. I felt a mild concern for the historic house, but, considering its distance from the ire and the stillness of the air, I believed it to be reasonably safe.

"Dr. H. was showing me one department and another of a great industrial school like Hampton or Tuskegee. We ended by attending a student's prayer meeting. Most of the pupils seemed to be mulattos, but I remember best one very black fellow who led in a long prayer. He made frequent references to points of compass, and I observed that in every such instance each hearer pointed in the direction indicated. I was surprised to see that Dr. H. imitated his neighbors, and I somewhat sheepishly followed his example. By and by the leader began to speak of some general who had just died. I have a haunting impression that it was General Hall which may have suggested the word, ""hell."" ""Lord,"" said the speaker, ""thou knowest where he is, perhaps in heaven"" (everyone pointed upward). The fingers dropped and pointed down, and the rest was silence.

"I seemed to be in the old High School building wandering through empty rooms. I was in an upper story. I came to a place where there was a hole in the floor and looked down. Below was a large room, of remarkable height, chiefly used for storage of chemical apparatus. I thought I would climb down by aid of a stack of shelves just under the hole. The distance to the floor was about twenty feet, and I felt dizzy as I started. The shelves made an awkward ladder, but I passed the upper ones and was gaining confidence when I came to one loaded with glassware. As I bore my weight on its edge, the shelf tilted and its unstable load of condensers and graduated cylinders shifted toward the verge. I struggled to keep my own equilibrium and to save the glass at the same time. Waging a losing battle, I woke.

I soon traced it to a table on which lay magazines and papers. Lifting several of these, I found a crumpled sheet of wrapping paper, and under this, in turn, an amputated arm, seemingly a child's. It was noticeable decomposing at the cut end. I took G. to task for leaving it there, but so far as I recall my feeling the annoyance was no stronger than I should have experienced if the paper had covered the untidy remains of a meal.

I remember particularly the close questioning of a sharp-faced officer with brown side whiskers as to the method of signaling with flags. Later I seemed to be off duty and sitting in a saloon of the same steamer as she tore along at wonderful speed through black, angry waters. I thought we were standing out into Massachusetts Bay. It seemed to be dusk of a cloudy day. Suddenly I was surprised to hear a railroad train. A glance showed it to be running on a low trestle parallel with our course. It was running at a high rate, but we left it behind in a moment. Then I saw houses near us, we must have entered a canal; the Universalist Church shot by, our speed was checked, and a voice called, ""Walnut Street, change for Newton Highlands."" As nearly as I can make out the ship canal must have been cut from Boston to Newtonville, and it must have ended at the head of Washington Park.

My comment on it was very much like this: ""This will be the spirit in which a new companionship between men and women will be developed.""

After he gave me the tickets, I slapped it in reverse and took off. This knocked him over, but I was still mad about the tickets.

I went in this room, and they tried to trap me. But I got out and that was the end of them. I felt like Ð just go away; this is my house. We were looking through all these really nice rooms. A hospital was on top of us. We went to the store. It was one of those really, really scary stores that was supposed to be scary. The store was in our house. In the dream I was thinking, ""Hey, I've seen that in another dream."" And I have. Doug (sister Valerie's boyfriend) was there. He went with us. He went off into his truck and just drove away. And there's supposed to be a ghost in there.

"Valerie, Nancy (19-year-old sister) and I were in the house alone. Nancy went outside to smoke a cigarette. This man and this lady came up to her and grabbed her arms. They held a gun to her and said, ""Where's your mom's money?"" We told them we don't have any money. They took out a gun. I said, ""Fine, we have lots of money."" Then Nancy came up to me and said, ""We don't have that much money."" I said, ""I know. I'm tricking them."" They said they would come back. Nancy left, and I was the only one there. I locked all the doors. I ran and I called for help because I knew they were going to come soon. I was scared. I thought they might kill Nancy. I was also scared that we might lose our money. I saw this guy, Mark; he was from my school. I said, ""Help me!"" There was this other man. Nancy and I were running outside and trying not to be seen. We ran up to this place that was a bar, and we got a drink of soda.

"There were these cowboys traveling. They were really good trainers, and they trained these buffalo to carry their stuff while they were on the horses. They went to this fort. This man, who was the head of the fort, gave them a sheet promising that they wouldn't kill the buffalo. Except it was the opposite on the sheet. He thought maybe they couldn't read, but they could read. They said, ""We need another sheet."" So finally he had to sign the thing, saying they wouldn't kill the buffalo because they carried the cowboys' things. When they were trying to find the sheet, the guy said that his mother was in charge. At the top of the sheet, it said, ""Sam"" something. And, he said his mother's name was Samantha. He was just trying not to sign it, but the cowboys wouldn't be tricked. They were smart. So he finally signed it. Finally, it was the day that they were going, and they saw that one buffalo was missing. They saw a Native American riding off on the buffalo. They got a rope, and they roped the Native American around the waist. The buffalo was already roped, and the Native American didn't see the rope because the rope was really long. The cowboys said, ""Do you want to walk or do you want to be dragged?"" The Native American said, ""I'm sorry. I'll just walk."" He walked over to them, and they finally unroped him. I don't know what happened to the Native American. But the cowboys rode off with the buffalo. I was just watching. I wasn't in the dream.

Then I hear the faint echo of the tubes popping. There is an underground bunker; most of us run for the school bus. The mortars are dropping close by, within twenty yards. The fear of realizing death is pacing through my mind. We are all crowded in, scared of a hit. I shield my face with two paperback books. All at once there is a sharp explosion.

In the dream, I am in a house; all of a sudden mortars begin to drop, close and very loud, and profusely, I remember feeling guilty, the house can withstand practically anything, but I am still terrified.

He brings up the subject of security and somehow mentions the name of Crazy Frank (used to play with the dead bodies). Suddenly everyone drops, we wait expecting the inevitable machine gun chatter etc., but it is only a false alarm. There are many soldiers spread about in not typical fashion, it appears more like a WWII beach scene than one of an LZ in Vietnam. A colored soldier rises up and makes an unclear remark. Apparently someone inadvertently set off a chain reaction, all of us obeying the instinct acquired from contact. The commander and I resume talk, we parley for a few more minutes; this time there is no mistake. I hear the sounds of mortars popping from tubes. I look at the commander and say, ""Mortars, run for the bunkers."" A mad rush for cover follows. In my mind I am counting off 8 seconds even as I am running; this is how much time I anticipate we have. There seems to be an air of complete disregard for everyone but one's self. The commander pulls and tries to get past me; I myself have completely forgotten the girl. The bunker seems familiar, as from another dream. It is too large to be representative of the ones I sought refuge in while in Nam. When I am just inside, mortars begin to drop, I make for a sturdy wall; the sounds, of explosions seem to be coming right over us. I seem to sense that this bunker is more like the basement of a large house, and that the mortars are hitting the building structure above us. The explosions have become deafening. In the last moments of the dream"" I am near an opening, I vaguely see the outside ground, for I am lower and must look up. A terrific whining descends overhead; a shell is going to drop very near to us. The blast takes place right outside the opening. I am knocked a few feet by the concussion, but not seriously injured. Very close, a machine gun opens up; it is a light 30 cal. We are under a ground attack. I wake up, bathed in the sweat of nocturnal madness.

The enemy is undoubtedly oriental, and it is at this point that I detach myself from my own person and either become another, or simply phase out and watch what follows, experiencing the drama vicariously, twofold it would seem, as this is all imagined. The enemy attacks and I become acutely aware of the feeling of being shot in the head. I am behind a wall of some kind, the danger of being hit is very great. In a fury I grab a silver object, which seems to resemble an rpg, and hurl it towards the foes. It explodes and immediately the entire area is shrouded in flames, even I (or the person I am watching) is/am enveloped. This is how the dream ends.

"We are on patrol somewhere in Nam. It is not my old unit but the feelings are the same. We are, the infantry lurking in the jungle. As usual we are spread apart, perhaps 4 to 5 meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see 25· to 30 meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh. I anticipate an ambush; things are going too easily. Beyond the stillness of our own guarded movements I sense another. With the first starting shots I drop instinctively to the ground. These are not the familiar popping sounds of the AK, though nonetheless I have anticipated correctly, we are in contact. Those up front fire back, immediately killing two. Then from my position I see two or three heads begin to rise. I yell to the others, at the same time pointing the muzzle of my 16 in the enemy's direction and attempting to fire. The gun jams. Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our 105s or 155s. The number 106 flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back. There is no pain, but I realize this to be a death wound. The last moments of the dream are obscured by the dust clouds.

He has been wounded in the arm. We gather about and form a defensive perimeter. A machine gun team of dinks stalks right up to us. It seems everyone is too scared to fire. I open up with three short bursts and literally rip the dink gunner in half. A while later, a single dink walks up to us, unmolested. I sense that no one is going to fire and spatter him wickedly with my M-16. It is a good feeling, though I am worried about ammo. We retreat to a large building and cluster fuck within. It seems almost like the room I am living in now. Several of us flop onto the bed and crash. I recall thinking about pulling guard twice a night. It is a wonder that we get enough sleep. I am tempted to doze off but the fear of dinks breaking in prompts me to stay awake. Someone has the side door covered.

Oddly, at first no one dives to the ground. Instead, we look to see what has happened. Capt. Hylo seems to be standing over a dead dink. Then hell breaks lose. The bamboo surroundings become a barren hilly expanse with dinks about us. They have some sort of modern building on a ledge 100 meters to my right. Way off I see a dink machine gunner beading on us. I open up on him. Then another dink MG appears, closer. I, too, have a machine gun, we will duel with bullets. Who will kill the other first? A dink on the ledge by the building hurls a grenade at me. I am lucky. It is a bit short of its target. I hug the earth and cannot recall being hurt. Next, the dink gunner rolls a base ball grenade towards me. I consider my chances against the time delay, grab it and hurl it a mighty length. It explodes harmlessly in the air. The duel renews. His bullets churn up staccato patterns of dust in front of me. I fire one long burst and catch him with one shot in the chest. He is dead. AK's blossom everywhere. It is like June 16, 1970.

I am lying on the counter in a prone position; the atmosphere is one of war. Sandbags and timber abound. The sky is eerily overcast. Bombs begin to fall. Not the mortars of past dreams but rather some kind of heavy artillery. A sharp thunder follows the initial detonation, as if there were some sort of dual explosive, or perhaps a new barrage tactic. I throw myself over and fall to the ground. Cowering under the counter I wait for the inevitable. Within seconds a shell crashes down upon the spot I had occupied and not too hastily vacated.

Night comes. All of a sudden there is a metallic burst of illumination flares. The sky lights up and we are showered by the magnesium brightness. For the first few moments no one knows what is going on. Who has called for the lume? Then, through the thin canvas I see two figures run past about 40 yards off. So, it is a ground attack. But I say nothing. Moments later the AK's open up. In the dream there are several old house where the gooks have holed up. My old platoon and I converge on it. With my M-16 roaring I cut down several dinks. I am overwhelmed by the sight of two individuals fighting with the enemy. Of all people, there is Mike W., our old RTO. I begin to fire, but my M-16 is sluggish; the bullets dumbly chug out. Wilson is followed by Juba, my friend from down the street, a high school buddy (who now I go to bars with every now and then). Juba has a long .45. His long drilling shots come after Wilson sprays me with a burst that catches me flush across the body. Again, though I am obviously hit, nothing happens. The firefight ends. We go back to the tent. I see bullet holes in my ankles. The Captain asks me if there is anything I want. I think of telling him, ""Yes! A Medivac,"" but I say only that we should dig foxholes. The next day I scrounge for ammo. There is little or none to be found, though I steal two grenades. I meet Roop and Melhop. During the fire fight, I use grenades but they prove ineffective. Even though I hold them for two or three seconds after the handle flies off (and they hiss like smoke grenades) they are thrown too hard and bounce away, and oddly, explode in a mere crackle of sparks, the way smoke does when it first ignites. Steve S. (a fellow from sleep away camp) and I go to the other side of the base. There is a small VN compound. Steve S. throws a grenade into a little wooden school house filled with children. It blows up and there are the horrific screams of the wounded. We walk down a trail. I am telling him how stupid he is for making this mess, surely there will be another attack tonight.

Two Chinese come up the hill on horseback. One dismounts and comes right up to the open ports of the shelter. He has a samurai sword. I lunge my M -16 into his chest and pull the trigger.

"In the dream I am a soldier flying a small balsa wood plane by telepathy. It crashes to the ground. Another solider sleeping nearby is wounded in the head. As I return to my living quarters I retell the incident to a group of soldiers that are following me. Two blacks become greatly excited. One takes out his pistol and wags it carelessly. I am shot in the thigh. I think of the dull pain that begins to throb. The blood begins to gush from my femoral artery. I wonder where I can find a tourniquet. I wake up.

"I am in Basic Training in the Army. A Drill Sergeant upbraids me. I beat and pummel him until he is dead. I go to Vietnam. I am with my old company but I am not accepted. I become a loner, an outcast. Roaming about, I shoot down American helicopters. At one point a Chinook lands and G.I.'s new to Vietnam come out and begin to march in single file. I shoot at them but instead of bullets only a spray of water falls on them.

"I am with a friend. We have traveled to a strange land. The people resemble the ""pineys"" of the Pine Barrens (in New Jersey). They are very kind and friendly; they share food and drink with us. I am easily at home with them. They present me with many small gifts. I am perched up on a high ledge. An old college English teacher is to read one of David B's poems. He (David) asks that he may read it himself. It is written in a very simple hieroglyphic form. There are crows and hawks and their feet markings: [drawing]. As he reads I become emotionally aroused. Moments later I am openly weeping. I return to this land with my old platoon. Everything has changed. The land has been scorched; nothing remains from the joyous past. I begin to load my M-16 but it is with the new and unfamiliar banana clip. We are ambushed. I squeeze off a few rounds before scampering for cover. I lose sight of my platoon. They patrol without me, the only medic. A sense of great overwhelming guilt follows. We relink later. I am ashamed of myself, but I am glad to see that the others are all safe. The Lieutenant is somewhat stern with me. The shame passes.

"There are several of us smoking dope in a small park surrounded by barbed and wire fences. Among those that I recognize there is John, David and Larry W., a Sgt. From Vietnam. From the corner of my eye I see the police. They charge up to us at a gallop and we are all busted. One fellow that I do not recognize makes a dash for it. He vaults the fence and heads for the woods. As the dogs are set after him I think that it is an impossible situation. As it happens, the fellow runs quickly and makes good his escape. We are herded to a jail in India. There are many rooms here, but they are small and cramped; the bars are quite thick. I think over and over to myself, as if the dream were real, ""This can't be happening to me, to me!"" But it is all too true; I am locked up. A turnkey opens a cell and allows David to leave. The jailer next turns to me and offers freedom if I will inform on the others. I think to myself, ""This is only a trick. Besides, I cannot betray my friends."" I anguish in the little cell. The dream ends.

I escape. There is a cave from which come holy sounds. The shadows of animals run across its walls. I am flying through rock, then thick, lava like water, then water. I see a piece of rope and with both hands reach for it. My head clears the water and I see that I am in a beautiful lake. Still clinging to the rope I am 1/10th my normal size.

Everyone in the class begins to laugh. Even the teacher, who resembles the plastic surgeon Dr. DeStefanol, breaks into a grin. The laughter, instead of subsiding, grows and grows, until it is followed by loud and sustained applause. Everyone is smiling, everyone is applauding, everyone is cheering. These people are all familiar to me, they are from my past. Here, they are depicted as children. The pitch grows higher. I am born aloft by the many hands and arms of the great crowd and deposited at the head of the class, alongside the teacher. There are four pretty girls with us.

"There is a war going on between the Americans and what appear to be either Germans or Russians. The battleground resembles the trench warfare of World War I. The land between the two sides reminds me of the no-man's-land of LZ Ranch in Cambodia. Each side is firing artillery, adjusting for accuracy. The shells fly back and forth and fall with muffled dull thuds. Then the other side launches a ground attack. They throw hand grenades as they run. The grenades hit the ground and bounce forward. I catch one and hurl it back. Then another, then two more. The others (other side?) do the same. I am in hand to hand combat with a man of about fifty; he is fat and ruddy looking. With a sinister leer he taunts me. Twisting his knife through the air he is easily the more skillful. I am lightly scarred several times but somehow, as my knife becomes a fork, I spear him in the throat, causing him a mortal wound. His eyes bulge forward; the gushing blood mixes with his last gurgling breath.

Then we see my father in the distance. He beckons to us. As we go, I hurl missiles in his direction. They are like giant bullets, arching up, then falling and crashing down. We speak to him about flowers. He insists that cultivation (gardening) is no different from nature. My brother and I argue against my father. The scene changes. Looking out a window I can see I am very high off the ground. A man below is reading off winning numbers from some sort of lottery. Thousands of people are gathering. He has somehow angered them. I fall out the window but somehow survive the fall. Then a huge oblong plate of metal tumbles down and strikes me a glancing blow on the head. I think it is a deathblow, as I am weak from loss of blood. I am weeping. My mother tries to comfort me. In between my sobbing I tell her to contact Peter A. (giving his correct address) and with this message say, ""Tell David [David B.] I'm sorry."" Then, as it appears that the wound is not mortal, I suggest we go and get an x-ray.

Two G.I.s already at the bottom of a hill mistake him for VC and direct fire at him, I hail them off, but it is too late. I see my brother being hit. Another GI from behind is also shooting at my brother. From fifty meters I hit him with a sustained burst from my M-16. The bullets wind through the air, arcing like artillery shells. Bob grabs the fellow I have wounded while I go to the aid of my brother. We take them both to a nearby hospital, which resembles my childhood grammar school. The doctor acts quickly, taking the wounded into the operating room, we go back, as there is nothing left for us to do. A fellow who I dislike intensely, another medic, sallies up on horseback from behind us and jeeringly announces that my brother is dead. I am heartbroken and begin weeping and sobbing, Then I turn around and with the strength that comes from great anger grab the horse by its throat and half wrestle it to the ground. My lamentations grow softer, until the mourning feeling is all but gone. As Bob and I return to the hospital we must cross a street. The area resembles the neighborhood of my childhood.

He is reading the section about Vietnam. I look at the pictures with him. Several NV A soldiers have dragged two dead GI's into a street and are castrating them. Then the images become real, and we are caught up in an NV A attack. It is dark and difficult to see and they are over running our position.

There are angry words written on its stock, but I cannot remember them. All around, Vietnamese men are frantically fighting, shooting back over a wall or barrier. I am lying on the top of a bunk bed, sorting through the belongings of someone. This person, apparently dead, had collected stamps. Paging through a small album, I see many American air mail stamps I recall from my youth. Suddenly a man nearby is shot and falls. I see the bullets kick and sting the dirt near him. Two nurses, wearing red and white striped dresses, come to his aid. They are completely vulnerable, turning their backs to the enemy. I am amazed at their bravery or foolishness.

"It is the present and I am with Bao Ninh in Vietnam. He leads me about, showing me different sites and soldiers. There is a certain intimacy, a certain understanding between us all. We communicate without language. At a rehab center I sit with a Vietnamese veteran who sketches pencil drawings. When he sharpens the point by pressing it into the blunt stub of his lower arm, I wince and offer help, but he declines. He is proud and self-sufficient and this is his way of doing things. In another room I see the drawings of school children. They are colorful, lively, happy. There is no sense of war.

"I am with the platoon on patrol in Antarctica. Those with foot problems are asked to go on sick call. Nearly all are lame, but march to the aid station in the cold, hard snow. They overwhelm the staff who make complaints against them. I am sad because no one cares, no one understands how we suffer. A kind, middle-aged black medic tells me that Timmy D., whose bad feet should have kept him out of the Army, will go home. But when I speak to Timmy D., he says he has been denied sick call. He has seen no one.

"It is dark. I am with the platoon in a foreign country. We are on an exposed slope facing the wood line. A voice mocks us. I am trying to invent a weapon that will fire small grenades more accurately than tossing them. The clumsy firing device resembles a slow-loading flintlock. Only the first grenade explodes in the wood line. Nearby Ed W. quickly chucks grenades one after the other. The platoon retreats. I become separated, lose my weapon and panic. Then we regroup and fall back. An old officer says my boonie hat is worn out. The flimsy material has lost its shape. My CMB pinned in front is missing, as are the encircling love beads, the Cav patch sewn on top, the grenade rings clipped round the brim. There is no ground-in muck, no accumulated sweat. This hat cannot be mine. We enter a large wooden house and line up in a stairwell, which leads to a cellar where we will be issued new hats. A pretty American girl with long hair makes her way past. I have no desire for her. It is a good feeling to be with my men.

The villager, who is middle-aged and wears a business suit, leaves his house. He walks toward me. I throw the gem in his face. ""What are you doing?"" I say. ""This is uranium."" Aloof and calm, he curls his hand around my neck, then releases it. We return to his house. There is the long flight home. I begin planning my escape.

My husband wanted to go to the church just in time for the ceremony so that we wouldn't have to sit there for such a long time. So the four of us got in a car and went for a ride. I kept telling them that we would miss the whole thing if we didn't turn around and go back. The road was being repaired and we had a difficult time finding a place to turn around. We passed a yard made of steps over a cave and remarked about its strangeness. When we returned the wedding was over. My sister was wearing a black dress. She had apparently married to the man she is now married to. We saw them talking to a child telling him that he now had a new daddy.

In a great hurry I picked up my dress and with my mother I ran downstairs to where the guests were waiting. I had not seen my future husband for several weeks and was very excited and anxious to see him waiting for me at the foot of the aisle.

Scattered here end there were mannequins with samples of wedding gowns. There was a group of around half a dozen of people 'shopping' for a wedding: looking over all the samples and discussing them with the bride, who was choosing which things she would have. It was closing time and the store's doors had been shut to prevent new customers from coming in. The employees told us that all the food from the caterers was going to be thrown away that night, so they encouraged us to try it all. We all went around and started eating, while the employees all stood around the far end, chatting and waiting for us to finish.

My mom was kind of saying ""you know so and so."" I couldn't remember for the life of me. Finally he arrived. I saw him and acted like I knew him. I thought I might actually have some vague recollection of the man, maybe a long time ago, but I wasn't sure. But I was like ""Oh yeah I remember you"", I think kind of to myself. He looked good but I had no feelings for the guy. I didn't even know him. I knew that a wedding simply could not take place. Finally, and quickly, I grabbed him and excused ourselves and pulled him into another room. I said ""I don't think I remember you, when did I meet you? When did we decide to get married?"" And he tried reminding me of the party, the one where we had met, a week or so ago, maybe a month. Then my mom and my aunt came in. And I went ahead and said ""We aren't getting married, we simply can't."" I felt really bad of course because they had gone to so much troubles preparing for this wedding. But I couldn't let this alter my decision.

"My good friend is getting married. I am in the wedding and we are all in the church. Only the guests are not sitting. We are all standing around the bride and looking at her because she is very pregnant and her dress doesn't fit anymore.

"It's always my wedding where I envision my dress, the place (from meadows to priests, to foreign countries to a temple), the ceremony, the creative vows, but never the groom. The dream changes depending on the period of life I'm in. They started approximately 14 years ago. They also tend to vary depending on what movie, TV show or book I'd recently been watching in reality.

"I was getting married to this guy I was going out with at the time. The dream was very upsetting. I could tell it was planned at the last minute. I didn't even have a wedding dress. No one I knew was there except for my mother, who I don't get along with that well. The last thing I remember is bursting out into tears and my mother saying ""Don't worry, it will be OK, you're getting married."" I woke up in tears.

"This dream is particularly fuzzy. All I can remember about my most recent wedding dream is that I'm marrying the person I'm in love with now. I can remember being incredibly happy and making plans to leave (probably like a honeymoon).

"I was getting married to my boyfriend, and that part was good, but the bad stressful part was that my mom (who was in charge of everything) hadn't organized a thing! She hadn't invited anyone or ordered anything. It was going to be the next day, at our house, and the house's backyard was a mess. Then it was the wedding day. My boyfriend and I went to buy a wedding dress. (Now we were in Santa Cruz, before it was at my home in LA.) The only stores open were thrift stores and used clothing stores. I am not positive but I think I ended up getting a wine-colored velvet mini-dress. Then it ended.

"Most of my wedding dreams are fairly similar. Most often the people getting married are doing so in some outrageous way. Like jumping out of an airplane, on a raft in the middle of a lake, or even on a rollarcoaster. I'm usually a guest at the wedding or a bridesmaid. I usually meet a man at the wedding and we usually become friends. The only things unusual about these dreams are the settings, the weirdest being when the bride and groom were being married jumping out of a plane.

"I was to be married to some unknown man. We were on horses inside of a catholic church. We got up to the altar, and I realized that I was making a terrible mistake. I wanted nothing to do with this man, let alone to marry him! I can't remember if I actually married him or not, but I'm pretty sure that I did. I have no idea how the horses came into the picture. In reality, I want to be married in the redwoods.

"It was a dream about someone I was seeing at the time and the preacher was doing his thing while we were looking at each other. The whole time I kept thinking it was a mistake, that I wasn't really doing this. Then I was sitting by myself looking at my wedding ring, and I desperately wanted to take it off, but I couldn't. I physically couldn't take the ring off.

"In all my wedding dreams, I'm getting married to my boyfriend. I usually don't realize that we're getting married until it's already started. Then I turn to him and suggest we wait until we're ready. He agrees and we turn around and walk away. (One time we were on a boat, 2x in a church, 1x on the beach.) There is always a crowd of people around us, so I don't recognize that we are walking up the aisle until we get to the guy holding a book. I don't see him being a priest, just a guy with a book. I'm always surprised when we walk into him. It's all very casual.
